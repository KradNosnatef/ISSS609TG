Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy.

1,664668402,2,2019-4,Singapore,"I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again.

5,658697573,2,2019-2,United Kingdom,"As my husband and I had a free day before we flew back home , decided to visit here, being that as we are over the age of 64 we got entry of just under   10 each depending on the currency rate. This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm.",Disneyland_HongKong,9,park disnei ride disneyland time visit hong dai queue small peopl food hk kong wait

As to for the mascots, finally saw them at the end of our day and only in the    town    part.Costumes were ruined by staff wearing black running shoes. OK they are on their feet and need to be comfortable but it was seriously jarring. Staff get a 2 10.Things like the recycling bin being loaded and taken away to be emptied but not one put in to replace. Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money.

If you in HK, do not go to this rip off expensive overpriced park, which is not even worth HK$10 let alone paying over HK$400. There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something.

15,647328225,1,2019-1,Australia,"Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience. Disney, we would like you to be more honest in your promotions and to honour what is stated in your pricing.

17,642534419,2,2018-12,Singapore,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back!

My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children.

21,633170265,1,2018-11,United Kingdom,Having visited Disneyland Paris some 25 years ago we decided to spend the last day of our holiday at Disneyland Hong Kong. The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff.

Omg I could pull my hair out, I would seriously go bonkers if I had to work there. When my kids were small, we went many times and I have to say, they absolutely loved it every time. We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long.

The park is very small and doesn't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesn't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim.

Take advantage of the fast pass system. If your ticket is crumpled or broken and the machine won   t accept it, there is a small inconspicuous button on the back of the fastpass machine that will print a fast pass ticket for you.

51,583615974,2,2018-5,Singapore,"My wife and I are Disney fans. We aren   t particularly fanatical but we have enjoyed our visits to Tokyo Disneyland and are the type to go before opening and stay till closing time. Since we were coming to HK, we couldn   t pass up the opportunity to visit HK Disneyland as I had never been before.Based on reviews online, I had already tempered expectations but even then, I was disappointed when we got there. The good thing was that the queue to get into the park and the rides was so short (we went on a weekday). I enjoyed the trackless mystic manor ride. The effects and the ride experience is one of a kind and highly recommended. Grizzly mine cart was fun too with 2 unexpected twists, no spoilers here.That   s about all the good I can really say, now the parts that disappointed:I don   t see what   s the point of letting guests in 15 minutes early to the Main Street before they open up the park proper. After they finally opened the park, I didn   t expect other parts of the park ( toy story, etc) to open at 11. They also closed earlier at 730pm. The place was already so small, surely they could organise it such that all parts of the park could open and close simultaneously.As we walked around the park, many snack stands were still closed and many cafes were closed for the day. It takes away from the festivity of the place.We were the first to sit Mystic Manor and we were excited but when we got to the ride, we found the girls standing around chatting and they looked surprised to see us. They then hurriedly rushed off to prep and asked us to wait 5 minutes. It felt like they lacked a lot of professionalism. The staff were also not enthusiastic and acted like they were there because it was their job and not because they had a love of Disney. They could fake it even if they didn   t but they didn   t bother and most looked very blas  .It did not feel magical at all. The food was also very mediocre. The crowd in general was a lot ruder than the crowd at Tokyo Disneyland. I had multiple groups of people cut in front of me while it was obvious I was waiting to take a picture of my wife and they saw me. People yelling across the street for each other. Some people tried to pick the best seats for the rides so service staff had to tell them to move down the line and they looked displeased they were told to do so.The stuff in the shops felt a little    recycled   . We saw goods from Paris Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland there. Felt almost like they were given the leftovers from other Disneyland resorts. Albert the monkey at Mystic Manor is a character unique to HK Disneyland but they were sold out for some of his goods and the sales lady said they weren   t sure if they were going to continue making it again. We went at 10, left by 430pm and don   t ever plan on going back. I expected much more and had hoped for a decent experience but I feel like HK Disneyland didn   t put in enough effort to make the place as magical as it should be, especially moreso for the ticket price they are charging. It felt like this resort is just riding off the popularity of the Disney name but it did not do it justice. If you really want to go, look for discount tickets, don   t pay full price. Go with kids since the queue is so short, they can ride the rides repeatedly and you don   t have to rush there in the morning. Also, unlike Tokyo Disneyland, there   s a proper line to do the character meet and greets so you will assured of a picture as long as you brave the long queues. It gets very hot during the summer so be sure to lather on sunscreen and bring a hat umbrella. There is barely any shade there. Use the lockers to stash your stuff, you can reopen them anytime so it is worth the money to get one. Nothing is cheap in Disneyland, the only magic I felt was how quickly your money goes while you are there.I really had hoped for more from Hong Kong Disneyland but I think I won   t ever return unless they do a major revamp, for both the park itself and its staff.",Disneyland_HongKong,9,park disnei ride disneyland time visit hong dai queue small peopl food hk kong wait

There are many outlets that have limited hours which makes it hard to even find a place to buy water.Come on HK Disney   focus on the experience of the guests. Don   t be so cheap.

We used our priority pass to skip the line for the slinky dog ride. They let us sit in the ride then because their dad was with the toddler and did not get a cart behind or in front and we wanted to sit together, so we got off and waited for the next turn. Once we waited for the first round to end, we were told because they gave out the bone tickets for the round after, we had to wait one more round. So we would get on the third round. Finally, it was our turn then the staff proceed to say my five month old has to sit by herself on the seat and not on a lap, I got angry. I waited there for three rounds and even sat in a ride cart and not one staff says a word about my baby on my lap. Then when I was about to sit next to my family and enjoy the ride they tell me I can   t have my infant on my lap. She can   t even sit by herself. They did nothing but say she can ride if she sits by herself and that plenty of babies ( pointing to toddlers and pre school aged children saying those babies can do it, why can   t mine) as if blind to my child   s small size in comparison. I asked for a manager, while waiting the staff that let me on the ride then kicked me off ran away to hide.If they told me when they saw me in line they should have said something then everything would have been fine.

We ran towards the stormtroopers and she happily raised her hand and waiting to be called. They were pointing out children or couple who will have a chance to have photos with them. My child kept on raising her hand and we were there standing for almost 20minutes. My child didn   t want to go until she was called. But I   m so tired and so I told her to go to Storm Troopers directly thinking that they will allow her since they kept on grabbing couples    who didn   t wait there   , children who just    passed by    or children who doesn   t want to have photos with them but apparently she was turned down by that stupid Storm Tropper assigned on March 31,2018 around 4pm.

It's quite far from HK but easy to get to by MTR although you will need to transfer a couple of time. It doesn't need more than 1 day to get through it. We bought 2 day tickets but actually did not regret it as the heat in August is oppressive and we could only stay for a few hours at a time. Favourite rides were the Grizzly Gulch train and Mystic Manor (as it was air conditioned). Hyperspace mountain was OK   Star Wars themed now but pretty tame coaster compared to the updated Space Mountains in other parks. Meet and greet with the Star Wars characters was also a highlight though. On the 2nd day, it rained a little and all the outdoor rides closed. Also all the food vendors shut down as well. Can't imagine what we would have done if we bought the food voucher. If you've been to other Disney parks, prepare to be disappointed.

Travelling there was pretty easy by MTR and rail. However, on the way, we were met by hordes of Chinese mainlanders, each going to the same destination. They are loud and rude and where there is a queue, they will certainly try to skip it. Sadly, this was the main theme throughout the day. After queuing at the entrance, and fighting off every single mainlander's attempt to jump the queue, we finally got in. The sun was shining and it was extremely hot. My advice is to take an umbrella or parasol with you to shade yourself, because there is very little shade indeed within the park. Queuing for the rides wasn't so bad. They are pretty fast, and you can select a time to return to save yourself some time. This is certainly what you must do for the more popular rides. The rides are generally suitable for children and even those who are afraid of rollercoasters can enjoy them without a fuss. But you must ensure that no one skips in front of you while queuing. Since there are no shades within the park, you are always on the lookout for a shop to relieve yourself with aircon. Although, there are some areas with aircon, there are also many shops that don't have it. I find it pretty cheap that they can't even turn the aircon on after you pay so much to get in.The food courts are jammed pack. You'd be extremely lucky to get a seat. The mainlanders all rush to get their food and the whole place is absolutely chaotic. It's probably the worse experience you will ever have. Fortunately, they serve the food pretty quickly and you don't have to wait long in the queue.By the end of the day, I was so knackered, I just couldn't move anymore.

No one can deny the global significance of Disney as a cultural symbol of American talent, creativity and command of the entertainment industry. As expected they have tried to translate that experience into a more local and regional  cultural dialect . That is why we have Disney parks in France, Tokyo, Hong Kong and so on. In the end when you visit those Disney parks in foreign lands you have a kind of split personality experience. You do not really know where you are and what you are watching. If you are from the USA or from a Western country, and traveling with your family, I strongly advise you to avoid Hong Kong Disneyland. Immerse your self in providing them with a real experience of a place that most probably they will not be visiting again soon. Taking them to Disney will just make them yearn for going back home and reduce their interest in experiencing the certainly much more confusing cultural landscape of this strange lands.

When they caught me I was about to walk back to the shop and return the goods. I had NO intention of keeping the goods. In their INTERROGATION ROOM it was a HORRIBLE  Disney  experience. Harsh, nasty, no empathy, no understanding, a situation I found threatening because I was surrounded by three large security men. There was more security than all of the years I   ve been going there. The attending woman security supervisor ( a  Miss A    a name that sounds like a  musical ) did not care about my reasons. She refused to contact any staff to validate my written complaints. I told her whom to contact and which department, and she refused ! She stated it was another department ! She was robotic and bloody minded ! Her words to me were insulting, and dismissive for the reasons of my actions. She stated to me that they had policies and procedures to follow. I replied that her staff did not follow any policies and procedures when I and my daughter were attacked. She was silent on this. She stated Hong Kong Disneyland will charge me for  theft  and the police will escort me to the Lantau Police Station. She stated that I should take my young daughter with me to the police station because I will be there for a long time. I told her that I could not do that because it will SCARE her. She kept. on saying that  I'm an adult and I should reflect on my actions . That goes both ways ! She lacked the humanity and common sense to understand the reasons for my actions, and she wanted my child to spend hours in a police sation with me ! I spent 12 hours in a police station; and I left at 3am in the morning. Economic loss to Hong Kong Disneyland is ZERO (the goods will be returned to them). Moneatary loss to me will be in the TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars in lawyers fee's to avoid a conviction ! And all because I was concerned about personal security and safety in Hong Kong Disneyland ! It   s clear to me that Hong Kong Disneyland ONLY cares about protecting (and selling) its overpriced cheaply produced plastic goods. When I and my daughter were attacked NO security personnel ever arrived, but when anybody takes their goods without paying then there is an army of security. The fact that Hong Kong Disneyland wants to prosecute me for my actions shows the true nature and character of the company. Yes I REGRET my actions; I was wrong to think so highly of  Disney  that they would understand my actions and the reasons for it. So much for a  caring  company. My daughter cried for several hours because I was in a police station, and my wife was immensely worried by Hong Kong Disneyland's actions against me. I was told,  by that woman , that I will be banned from returning for a year. Return there after this PHYSCHOLOGICAL TRAUMATIC  Magical Experience  ?

Having been to Disney World in Orlando several times, this park was much smaller scale and was a bit underwhelming by comparison. At the outset, we were frustrated because my husband purchased tickets to the park online upon our arrival at the park, and we were told we would have to wait one hour before we could gain entry, even though he had received a confirmation of purchase. Not what we wanted to hear when we had three eager children at the gates. We were really disappointed by the lack of characters to be found around the park. Plus, we tried to visit with Mickey and Minnie, Pluto and Jessie from Toy Story, and each time we were told to come back later, as they were closing for a break. It was a little frustrating that they don't have replacements available. We waited in long lines  generally 30 minutes to an hour for each ride  but we were there the day after a Chinese holiday so it is possible that we encountered higher than normal crowd volumes. This meant that in the 7 hours we stayed, we only rode 7 rides, and took one breaks for a beverage and one for lunch. In addition, they shut down three sections of the park at 4:30 for special events, which undoubtedly also contributed to overcrowding of the rides.

Security is a joke   they don't actually tell you anywhere what you aren't allowed to take in which means that nobody knows and this creates a huge queue with people asking why they can't enter with things and arguing about where they can leave things to collect them on the return. The queue management for everything is just a disaster from buying tickets, queuing to get in and out of the park and buying food   it's slow and badly organised and if you go in the summer most of the time you are waiting outside in 30 degree heat.

Not sure why Disney doesn't offer a bus service to the park entrance from the metro station and the buses that take you to the hotels. Buses to hotels were also a complete disaster. You have to wait again in a long queue and the bus stops at the Disney World hotel first and then moves on to the Hollywood Hotel. Not sure why they can't have separate buses as it just makes the journey so much longer. Park was a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Dear Sir or MadamI am writing this email after my recent depressing and discouraging visit to Hong Kong Disneyland with my mom and my daughter Emma dated 2 Aug 2016. It took several days for me to make this formal complaint because I want to make sure I was not outrageous for the time being but disheartened for good. I do hope you can take some of your time and hear out the story of what happened to us back then.We are Chinese citizens coming from Hainan Province. My daughter is four years old, and she is extremely eager to meet the princesses in person and take photos with them. Hong Kong Disneyland increased the price and Shanghai Disneyland recently opened notwithstanding, we still chose to visit Hong Kong Disneyland because we saw your MARVELOUS advertisement of your wonderful 10 YEARS ANNIVERSARY. We stayed in Hong Kong over the night of 1 Aug and arrived at the Park around 10:30 the next day. However, one hour after our check in when we are queuing up for the raft to the Tree House of Tarzan, the staff dismissed the queue and informed us that all the outdoor activities will be cancelled due to the  3 storm signal. No Cinderella. No Snow White. No Elsa. No Aurora. No Rapunzel. No parade. You cannot imagine how dispiriting and frustrating it was for the 4 year old little girl.It was the first time for Emma to visit an amusement park of its kind. To make this trip colourful and meaningful for her, I spent 8 weekends watching the Disney classic movies with Emma, especially the Disney Princess collections. We chatted over night to discuss which princess she liked the most. We played games together to recreate the scene of each princess movie. Unfortunately, it just turned out that the more you longed for meeting the princess, the more disappointing you got.From then on, at least 3,000 visitors thronged in door and heavily queued up for the only programs left over. We spent at least one and a half hour waiting for the small world. What is worse that we were informed that the park would be closed shortly due to the  8 storm signalI could not just believe it. The dinner was off the record because all canteens and shops in the park shut their doors suddenly. With no restaurants nearby, I had to bring little Emma of 4 and my mother of over 60 back to the downtown without dinner. Not to mention how disappointing we were leaving without seeing the fireworks.I know you would defend yourself using the typhoon excuse, and it is very true, nobody will deny it. Nevertheless, it is your cold heartedness and your negligence that irritate me. Nobody even showed the slightest care for the little boys and girls and the aged. YOU just THREW us out, which is the last thing I can imagine to happen in Hong Kong Disneyland. I cannot understand it and will not accept what had just happened to us. With the modern technology, you should know the typhoon is coming and you know much better than anybody exactly how it will affect the park. It seems to me that you just care more about the number of visitors rather than their expectations and experiences. Maybe you could close the Park for good and post an advance notice, or you could pretend to be sorry and try to be a little bit nicer to your guests, but you chose to do nothing. Oh, I am sorry that you did do something when you made a great effort to kick them out.I chose Hong Kong Disneyland over Shanghai because I believed your 10 years anniversary will be more wonderful than usual; because I believed your staff will be more civilized and more experienced, so that my daughter will enjoy her meeting with princess more happily. Sadly, it is such a fool of me to have believed all this and none of it came true. Of course, it is surely not a trip of empty hand. I   ve learned my lessons: never trust the illusory advertisement.

But we when got there, people were already allowed into the park. Which was strange. We went on a weekday and even though the park opened at 1030. Toy Story land didn't open until 11 and closed early at 8. Many restaurants were closed but we weren't sure if they were closed because it was a weekday. We wanted to eat at Explores Club restaurant but it didn't open until 12. We notice many snack food stands did not open until 12. We rented a stroller inside the park which cost $100HKD   $100HKD deposit you will get back when you return the stroller. If you want to do Jedi Training for ages 4 12 do the sign up first thing when you get in because it will get full. We bought tickets at DisneyLand Hollywood Hotel the night before. We generally don't go to the most popular rides first we went until the end of the night when the crowds die down and there isn't a huge wait. One of the most popular rides is The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh that is also a FP but we opted to go right after the night parade and the wait was only 15 minutes. The Buzz Light Year ride we went right before the firework show at 8:50 and there was no wait. The kids loved ToyStory land and went right when it opened at 11 and we waited only 5 minutes for the rides. You are allowed to bring in food and drinks. Personal space does not exist and people will be literally on top of you when you are in line. We watched Festival of the Lion King which is great and we waited outside. We didn't understand why we couldn't wait inside the air conditioned theatre. People will try and cut in line so beware. Our little 4 year got pushed by adults because she walked too slow.

Due to the guests from mainland China there was a lot of queue jumping which resulted in a lot of fighting and pushing. The staff of the park did nothing to control these people. We stayed for four days but after day two my children did not want to go to the park anymore due to these rude, unbehaved guests from the mainland. Toilets are disgusting with human feces on the floors   again due to these uncivilized guests. The staff are rude and not all of them can speak English. They shout and scream at everyone. It was hot and all queues are in the sun. So be prepared to stand for hours in the sun in a queue with people pushing and breathing on you. I cannot recommend this park to anyone with small children. During the parades adults are pushing you. On more than one occasion I almost dropped my child due this. I visited this park about seven years ago and it was totally different. It definitely worsened over the years. If you are looking for a fun filled family vacation at a theme park, please AVOID this one at all cost.

I told the staff there that they shouldn't let this happen but they did nothing abt it just kept saying oh no they have been in line! I was standing for almost 45 minutes in que and the line Infront of me was getting bigger than smaller and they say nobody broke the line! I even called mr Andy who was the rad there and told him but he was quite rude too found him arrogant as he was only speaking n hardly listening so I left without any pictures with my daughters fav characters!Also at the Hollywood hotel no characters came to meet kids as is expected out of a Disney property!they had no great activities for kids and the pool they had was also shut down!We felt rather silly booking that hotel because there was nothing to do!All in all a very bad experience and I don't think I will ever come to Disneyland again!,Disneyland_HongKong,9,park disnei ride disneyland time visit hong dai queue small peopl food hk kong wait

227,332795875,2,2015-8,Oman,"This was my first visit to HK Disneyland. I have previously been to all other Disney parks (Florida, California, Paris, Tokyo) at least 2 times each park. So I know a little bit about Disney parks.My daughter and I visited HK Disneyland in August 2015. The weather was warm and waiting for rides was an uncomfortable experience. For example, the waiting area for the Jungle River Cruise was a shaded area that only had 2 fans. With many people waiting for their turn for the ride, the air was very stall and it was uncomfortable even to breath normally while waiting for the ride. We went in the English language Jungle River Cruise. I have been to this ride in other Disney parks previously. This ride is normally very entertaining and the comments by the guide are generally funny. Not in HK Disneyland. The guide was not using a PA system and it was difficult to hear him clearly. What I was able to hear of his commentary was not funny or entertaining at all. (Yes, his English accent was also very bad).The park is small compared to other Disney parks, and has limited rides. Many of the rides were the merry go round type of rides e.g. Dumbo, Orbitron, Cinderella Carousel, tea Cups, Slinky Dog Spin. These rides may have been fun 50 years ago, but they do not appeal too much to the younger generation these days. Disney needs to come up with new ideas for their rides.The light parade at night is normally one of the highlights of Disney parks. Not in HK Disneyland. The parade only had a limited number of floats and was over in around 15 minutes.The fireworks display at near the closing time is also normally a highlight of Disney parks. Not in HK Disneyland. The fireworks here were basic type and only lasted a few minutes.As in other Disney parks, food and beverages in HK Disneyland were overpriced.Another negative point here is that many people did not want to queue up in waiting lines and they would jump the lines. This would happen while the Disney park attendants were around. The attendants never intervened to stop people from jumping the lines. RUDE.Overall, our experience was not a good one at all. If you have been to other Disney parks, please skip this one. If this is going to be your only Disney experience, please be ready for limited rides, bad management of park facilities and people jumping the queuing lines while park attendants not enforcing any disciple.

Right after the ride was over, my little son ask if he can ride again and refused to get off the horse as any 3 years old kid having too much fun would. So I try to explain to him that it is not permitted and we have to get in line again. At this moment, I caught one of the attendants approaching and I turned to my son and said:  You can ask the lady here if you can ride again. I was expecting the young lady to use the normal friendly Disney attitude to explain to my son that he needed to lineup if he wants to ride again.But instead, she put on a stern face and said:  Of course NOT! At this point, although a bit surprised, I was still thinking that she was putting up an act for me.So I turned to my son and said:  See, you cannot ride again. Let's go find mommy. As you can imagine, my son started crying immediately.What happened afterwards was truly unbelievable for Disneyland.Instead of helping me a least bit to comfort my son, this young lady turned to me in a very rude manner and asked me:   You need to bring him down from the horse, and hurry up! In hindsight, it is very possible that this young lady has mistaken that I was asking to take the ride again. But I must say, even if that was her understanding, was that the way Disneyland treat a 3 years old birthday boy? What happened to the happiest place on Earth?I did not want to make a scene immediately since my son was with me. But I have managed to report this incident afterwards to the gentleman operating the ride at the said time. This whole exchange was conversed in Mandarin, and it made me suspicious if it was her bias against Mainland customers? I am a Chinese US citizen born in Hong Kong.

Having been to all the other Disneys (with the exception of Japan) I was looking forward to another great experience. I was expecting a smaller park ( something like EuroDisney) but was REALLY disappointed by just how little there was to do in the Hong Kong offering. It looks as though they have just taken all their  baby  rides from the other resorts and tried to pass them off as the full Disney experience. As an adult couple the only rides worth taking were Space Mountain, The run away mine cart and Mystic Manor. We queued for over an hour for  Autopia  only to find that the ride consisted of driving an electric pedal car around a railed track at a maximum speed of about 3km  hour. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!! There were none of the usual aatractions Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones, Small World, Peter Pan, singing bears etc etc  basically, if you enjoyed it at the other Disneys you won't find it here. If you are travelling as an adult couple and don't have kids under 10 you should go to Ocean Park instead. We are now planning to spend the last day of our trip there as I've heard they really cater for the adult market  lots of roller coasters etc. it seems Hong Kong Disney has decided to focus on the toddler end of the market  which is OK if they don't mind warning customers before they pay out $400 HKD !!!

Rather go to Ocean Park.Disney went to no trouble at for this years Halloween.The last time we visited for the Halloween program was in 2012 when it was excellent! A scary Haunted Hotel and other fantastic walk through attractions. Lots of actors dressed up in Halloween costume and mingled with the crowds. A wonderful parade of ghostly spectres dancing in Main Street......sadly, that was not to be repeated.2015 offered some really lame entertainment. Ghosts Rising  is a dozen or so actors dressed in white. They walk out and then pose for photos with the crowd. Apparently they are acting out a story. This all lasts for 40 minutes I am told. We didn't stay till the end, it was just was boring. The Haunting of Grizzly Gulch  has an old guy walking on to a stage swinging a lantern. Then 5 guys dressed in black wearing cowboy hats follow onto the stage. Next thing I see one of the Cowboys has a puppet horse...I had seen enough.The final Halloween attraction is  Curse of the Emerald Trinity.  It's the Jungle River Cruise, Done at night with a bit of green fog. Not scary and only done in Cantonese.I'm not sure what changed at Hong Kong Disney, but I will never waste my time to return for another lame Halloween. If they don't want to do Halloween for whatever reason, that's fine. But then don't advertise a Halloween program. My kids were so exited to go. We dressed up and left bitterly disappointed.

249,315792517,1,2015-9,Hong Kong,"The day was plagued by problems. Firstly due to a buyout by Citibank the three latest additions: Toy Story Playland, Mystic Point and Grizzly Gulch, where closed at 16:30   this was communicated in a very jovial  to help you plan your day  kind of way around the park and was mentioned upon arrival. However there was no indication of this simple fact on the website.This was essentially OK because I was able to do multiple rounds of the rides in the soon to be closed areas. However there where more issue:Going for a serviced sit down lunch though was a true challenge: the only restaurant offering something substantial was the Plaza Inn. The food was absolutely horrific and took ages to arrive. The service did not pick up on this either and when I complaint to the server there was a blank stare and an  oh    no excuses where made whatsoever. All in all I wasted more than 90 mintes for 5 or so nasty plates of food, including a cold piece of duck and a  signature  spring roll that seems to consist only of rice paper without any filling. I asked for the bill and this took more than 10 minutes to arrive. After 15 minutes of waiting I put down the money and left   only to be chased by the waitress and a manager and was told I left too little money and should have added 15% for  service . When I told them what happened I was again met with blank stares and without any comment. Lots of other things where closed too including the Tahitian Terrace which had a sigh posted saying it was closed  temporarily , I went in anyway only to be told that this restaurant would open after 16:30   so why not communicate this timing properly with signage instead of giving no indication of what  temporary  might be?After queuing up for an ice cream and deciding and paying for two scoops only to find out there are only three flavors available is also something one does not expect when the website screams  refreshing flavors  you can cool of on at It's a small world ice cream. Worse: the mango ice cream didn't taste like mango at all and was gooey tasting of too much uncooked flour and not at all fruity.Upon returning to Adventureland it turned out that the Jungle Cruise and Rafts to Tom Sawyer (as well as the Tree house) had also closed early: this had not been communicated at all during the day, and since I had focused on the area that was  advertised  to be closed early I was not able to do these attractions either. Attraction staff completely neglected complaints saying these early closings  where part of the regular operating program . The same was true for the railroad encircling the park as well as some character meet and greet areas.Staff did not really look they wanted to be there either, did not take pride in their work and overall morale was very low.

Mystic Point and Grizzly Gulch are two of the best Disney rides in the world, but a good park experience is made up of more than the hardware, the software is probably even more important and this is what is significantly lacking here.

287,259199585,2,2015-2,Indonesia,"I've been here twice already. So I get a bit of a comparison. Attraction wise not much have changed since my first visit around 5 years before. So it seems that HK Disneyland does not progress very quick. It even has less entertainment going now. Previously there are lots more entertainers going about the park, such as the princesses taking photos with the kids, bands using garbage can, guys on stilts, and so on. The second time, we only got Chip right beside the entrance taking photo, and later on Stitch in the area. No other entertainer met during our whole day there. and it seems a massive decrease of entertainers compared to 5 years ago. That's a let down for us and our kids, since we are hoping to meet a lot of characters from the Disney World.But the real problem lies in the queues. On average we need around 30 40minutes queuing time for each ride. and there are no express lane. there is a system of gaining a fast pass ticket for some of the more popular rides, where it states at what time you should get back to have fast entry to the rides. although this is quite good, the problem is you cannot get any other fast pass before the one you held earlier expires... this is a major problem. For example, I took a fast pas on 12pm, and the fast pass state that I need to get back to the ride at 2.30 3.30pm. now this is definitely too long (2,5 hours) so I need to get back to the ride at 2.30pm and ride it (or wait until it expires at 3.30pm) before I can take another fast pass to another ride. you can imagine if I take another fast pass at 2.30pm it will require me to get back again at 4pm. that is too long. and in the meantime via the regular queue we still have to stand in line for 40 minutes each. I spent too much effort while i was there trying to be effective with my time there. I NEED to be effective since I'm there with small children (as with everyone else). after 3 times queuing for 40 minutes each, children will get cranky for taking so long to ride just one attraction. We also got an incident with another group of people that try to cut our queue. We were there patiently waiting in line and trying our best to control our children so that they can also wait patiently in line, and then another family (that doesn't speak English too well) tried to cut in front of us. that is the last straw and we had a scene. although this is not Disneyland direct fault, they should have staff and attention board to notify that everybody should queue in line and may not cut in front of anybody else. this is particularly needed since the influx of non English speaking tourists that tends to also have no decent manners in modern society.overall, Disneyland Hong Kong should not use the tag line  happiest place in the world  anymore.

288,257097884,1,2014-8,United Kingdom,"This was my first time going to a disneyland and I never expected it to be that bad. Firstly, HKD is way too overcrowded and they don't limit the amount of visitors there is a day, I believe that 200 people should be the maximum since I only went to a couple of rides: space mountain ( fast track ticket ) , Buzz lightyear astro blasters, jungle river cruise, Autopia, It's a small world, stitch encounter and slinky dog spin. For me, the stitch encounter and the slinky dog spin was the worst because the stitch encounter was basically watching Stitch talk and having a chance of talking to him ( on screen, for children ) and I thought it was a ride, the que was horribly long ( 1 hour on a hot day ) The slinky dog ride was very bad either, 45  minute que to go on a dog ride ( 3 4 laps of a a circle ) which made the ride less than 1 hour. However, I do recommend Autopia, space mountain, astro blastersand the jungle river cruise. On the other hand, the food there was disgusting and dry which costed 98 hong kong dollars ( equivilent to   9.80 uk money ) What a rip off       . The staff had bad manners, the one i experienced was the one in the jungle river cruise. Somehow, they show disrespect to mainland China people since my family and I split the group in half because half of us wanted to rest and half of us wanted to go on rides, so they found a ride and they called us to go and when we reached there they didn't let us through since they thought we were que cutting but my family was at the front of the que and they were talking disrespectfully to my uncle as his first language is mandarin but his cantonese is good. But, when my mum came and spoke cantonese they went silent and let us through. Here we can the see the discrimination between hongkongese and chinese mainlanders. Also, people from south west china have better manners than mainlanders so I don't understand why they think we are mainlanders. Im from the UK and find this a rasict. In conclusion, I found HKD terrible, I do not reccomend HKD to people because of the overcrowded visitors. The positive thing about this trip is that you get to watch the 9:00pm fireworks and get to LEARN YOUR LESSON. The park opens at 8:00 or 9:00 and closes at 10:00 but when my family arrived, there were a bunch of people already there. Also, be careful since you are at risk of having your children lost.

Common excuses are some family member at the front of the queue when everyone else are toeing the line. And when you dare to even confront them for cutting queues, they cause a major commotion, and challenge you to a fight. Shame on these Mainland Chinese tourists. As an oversea Chinese myself, I could easily observe these Mainland Chinese tourists are despised at for their aggressive behaviors, and the rest of the Chinese folks (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South East Asia, overseas) generally have way better manners. Disneyland HK really needs to implement stricter rules and penalty to these queue jumpers. They are a total nuisance to everyone else.Food by the way is exorbitant as the park totally monopolized the eateries and have little regards for taste. They would first scan your bags for food before entry and force you to dump any, and once you are in there, the food is 3x more expensive than normal Hong Kong caf  , and taste extremely bad.

Well, the one in Hong Kong must have the most exasperated parents on earth.The kids alternate between brief moments of joy and long bouts of boredom and frustration.I had expected Disneyland to be crowded and the queues long, but I was relatively hopeful that Disney's vaunted queue management systems and methods would help alleviate that. After all it's their core business. This wasn't much in evidence however. In Disneyland Hong Kong queue management appears to consist of telling the people queuing how much longer they have to wait. The information isn't even up to date. On the Slinky Dog ride in Toy Story Land I was handed a card with the time I'd joined the queue written on it. By the time I'd reached the front of the queue 40 minutes later, and the card was taken from me to record a 40 minute wait time, I'd hazard a guess that the people joining the back of the queue would probably have had to wait an hour.It's true that one can use FastPass, to book a later time and return. In the rides I managed to go on however, the FastPass queues were about a quarter to a third the length of the main queue, so that wasn't working either. It just delayed the main queue even more.Many rides were also not filled to capacity. On the Winnie the Pooh Hundred Acre Wood ride, my little family of three and an infant took up a car meant for six. On the Slinky Dog ride, an additional two adults could have squeezed into the car occupied by my three year old and myself. No wonder the queues are long.There were other irritations   turnstiles to exit some rides, for example. This just means that people pile up at the exits. The entrance to the Lion King theatre was packed with no queue management whatsoever, so when the doors opened, there was a headlong rush for seats. Perhaps the visitors aren't used to queuing, but Disney employees should set out queue lines, remind their guests of their obligations to others, and manage an orderly entrance. My little boy was pushed and jostled, it wasn't a pleasant experience for him.We arrived at the park at 10 am when it opened. We did Adventureland including Tarzan's Treehouse and the boat ride, we saw the Festival of the Lion King stage show, and Grizzly Gulch, and we went on the Slinky Dog ride and the Winnie the Pooh Hundred Acre Wood ride. That was it. We left the park at a quarter to four, and we spent nearly 2 hours in queues.Compared to Ocean Park, where the staff were energetic and helpful, and genuinely wanted to make the experience as pleasant as possible for their visitors, the staff at Disney seemed disinterested and focused on telling people about waiting times. It's a shame; the helpfulness of the staff would have made a great difference to what was ultimately a fairly horrendous day. Save your money, visit Ocean Park instead.

389,160878145,2,2013-4,India,"HKD 450 for adults, 320 or children is an outrageous price for HK Disney. It completely lacks the Disney Magic and is so small that I could not believe they could charge so much for this tiny park. Take the main Castle for instance. The one in Florida looks like a real castle while this one looks like a miniature put in for the sake of making it look like a Disney theme park. The overall feel of Disney is completely missing from HK Disney. It just does not seem magical at all! The rides barring 2 or 3 are really lame...good for a 5 year old perhaps.The Grizzly bear ride was nice and the fireworks show is good at night. They have provided plenty of water fountains which is good. Snacks are expensive (HKD 35 for a small popcorn or HKD 28 for cotton candy). Inspite of reports that Disney wont allow you to carry your own food, we took plenty of it. I would have strongly argued that they cant decide what I should eat and what I shouldn't and cannot stop me from taking my own food inside (we are vegetarian so our choice is extremely limited in such places) . They looked at my bags and the food but didnt stop me from taking it in.My honest suggestion is for people to visit Ocean Park. Half the price, 10 times the size (no exaggeration) and much more entertaining. My kids agree! This is especially true if you are planning to visit Disney in Florida anytime in your life. Dont waste time on HK Disney.As of early May if you bought tickets with a VISA card, you could get 11% off at the ticket booth outside Disney.

Getting there is so easy, just take the MTR to Sunny Bay and change to the Disneyland Express. Journey takes about 30 minutes from central Hong Kong. The train is fab and so is the station and the entry... but that was kind of  it  for me. It was a cloudy day, not much people and no real queues to talk about but it took us approx 20 minutes to get tickets to get in, then there was the security line to check the bags. Not a problem but I can imagine the chaos on a busy day. You walk into Main Street and well.. its a street full of shops selling Disney merchandise and sweets... even the bread is sweet and finding anything else became a challenge. We saw Mickey and went to get a picture just to get told that the waiting time was 1.5 hours so we gave up. We worked our way around just to find 3 of the major attractions  closed for reconstruction   sorry for your inconvenience ... doesn't help me when I paid almost $70 AUD to get in. Where was the signs at the gate that some attractions are closed?It doesn't really take a lot of time to walk around, I was looking for Disney characters or themes, but I found it scarce. All day I saw Mickey once and Minnie once as well and that was it! Its supposed to be like walking into the  World of Disney , but this was more a  sell as much Disney merchandise as we can , a few half bad attractions on the side and some nice gardens. Another thing were the waiting times... as I mentioned, it was a slow day, not many guests but the wait was still about 15 minutes on most rides... as said before, I don't want to be here on a good day... I have to say that the Gulf was a really good ride but the rest of the ones that were open I could do without. I think that if you have young children and you don't mind lining up and waiting it could probably be a fun day out, but not for the older ones.

Off from Indonesia  a 5 hour sky distance from HK  we were all geared up for a full day of fun. Kids were looking forward to it, a full pay off after midterm exams. That morning, we came early with loads of kids' neccessities and my personal photographic gears. Kids' stuff included raincoats, spare clothes  as it was pedicted there would be light showers and for getting prepared for some wet actions. My personal photographic gears included those heavy full frame DSLR body and lenses  as my visit to the park wouldn't be complete without taking some great shots of my family with famous backgrounds such as Disneyland.I packed all those gears in one plane cabin sized roller bag, thinking that it would be too heavy to carry around. What an unpleasant surprise I received from the gate attendant that morning, instructing that I should take out all the heavy gears and leave the roller bag at the deposit counter outside the park at HKD 60 fee. It wasn't the fee that made me upset, but the fact that they commanded me to carry the heavy loads without a roller bag. They even said:  You could take turn carrying them since you have 10 people with you!  What a statement! I thought to myself:  Doesn't she see half of my group consists of children? What a thoughtless statement to have small children carrying heavy loads around while they should have fun riding and enjoying the park's variety of treats and snack? What disappointed me was that there was no precaution whatsoever made to me prior to my coming  whether on the website or at the tickets agency that visitors should NOT bring any roller bags into the park. I ended up carrying all the heavy loads around on my back. Imagine bringing those around for 11 straight hours! I could not enjoy one bit of my visit to HK Disneyland this time, even though still trying hard to take good pictures. We went back home with my back hurt. It was such a hurtful treat from the staff at Disneyland having such a mindless service to visitors like us. I do not know the rationale behind this rule. I could only guess  it could be for security purposes, or commercial purposes. The latter being to stop visitors for not spending to purchase foods offerred from inside the park, if they bring ones from outside.I do not know exactly their reasons, but one thing that had left me with after visiting the theme park, and that is being hurt and disappointed.

Im a big Disney fan girl.However, Hong Kong Disneyland was a huge disappointment. It started off promising, we got there by the MTR and was excited to see it had special Mickey shaped windows on the train and hand rails on the roof. We got there and the station seemed impressive...then it started to rain. Ok, cant help bad weather I guess. It turned torrential so we had to buy ponchos to keep dry, and as the line to buy tickets was LONG we were rained on for about 30 45mins before even getting inside.I was drenched by the time I did get in, and the lines were very long. That wasnt so bad, but people constantly pushing in the line that day was getting more than annoying. At the Anahiem Disneyland, all staff members are refered to as the  crew  as everyone is in character, even the ride attendants and people in the shops, everyone is super happy and friendly. Not in Hong Kong, no one was in character and there was no Disney  vibe  at all. It was very disappointing.Not only that, but I was the only one in our group who had been to a Disneyland before, so I was talking up how great it was going to be, and of course everyone else in my group had been dreaming of going to Disneyland since they were kids. They hated it. I tried to tell them this HK one was just terrible, but the one in Anahiem is amazing but they wont listen, they wont be going to Disneyland again after such a bad day at Hong Kong's Disneyland.Lonely Planet's description is spot on, give it a miss unless you have very small children. Only they will like it. Maybe. Its all just a merchandising opportunity at the Hong Kong Disneyland.

The problem lies in people's expectation and perception of a Disney Theme Park over the years through various media, or through physical visits to actual sites such as Disney USA, Disney France and Disney Japan, so it is highly likely that one will have high expectation prior to the visit. There are many negatives when compared to other International Theme Parks:1. Small when compared to other Disney Theme Parks;2. To crowded (long queues when paying for shopping or waiting for rides);3. Too many mainland Chinese tourists (and many will consider them to be 'rude', i.e. jumping queue, sticking closely behind you when queueing, etc);4. Insufficient and lack of cooling ventilation equipments when queueing outdoor or in shops (should install water cooling fans in all strategic outdoor locations like at Universal Singapore) I have been to many Theme Parks all over the World and my visit to Hong Kong Disney in August 2011 was considered one of the worse for the reasons stated above. My family and I did not enjoy the experience, and we felt like suffocating be it indoor or outdoor due to lack insufficient of fans air con. We paid for the entrance fee, walked in and out without taking up any events or rides. My advice is to lower your expectation prior to your visit; be prepare to accept those negatives stated above; and you may find yourself enjoying the visit more than me.

The characters were barely there, you would wait in line to take a photo, and the courtesy wasn   t even there to inform you that someone would be the last or that the character was leaving.

On the day we were there, the weather bureau issued a typhoon 3 warning, and as a result they shut down all the outdoor rides. However during the entire day we were there, there was hardly a breeze. The management should be a bit more flexible and reopen some of the rides as there was no risk or danger. The only plus is that the Lion King show is worth a visit.

Unfortunately, it seemed like the Jungle Cruise and Small World boats moved quicker than in Anaheim.Besides being smaller than we expected, what lessened the experience was a general lack of accepted protocol by most of the attendees. In Anaheim, we are used to waiting in line. At this park, queues were largely ignored, and people often went around others pushing their way through the line. Even at Small world, where people are lined up in aisles to get into the boats, people would climb over the seats to get where they wanted. At one show, an altercation broke out as people were pushing their way into the theatre. Park staff tried to keep the participants separated and started the show as they were still shouting at each other across the theater. Even on the Jungle Cruise, the driver (They had separate lines for English and Chinese speaking) incessantly admonished riders to keep their hands in the boat (which got very close to moving attraction parts).

The entire area right next to Golden Mickeys was also very well done. However, we were VERY disappointed with the Stich Encounter attraction. This attraction is so small and the wait is so long (over 45 minutes), it is not worth it. Actually we thought the show area was just a pre show area, it was tiny and very poorly done. It is very obvious this attraction was hashed together last minute to address the shortfall of attractions in this park.I seriously hope that HK Disneyland could include more signature disney attractions available in all other parks, namely Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Toontown.

For my first fastpass I could go back within 1 hour but my second fastpass I obtained before 1pm allowed me to take the ride only at 6:30! The rides are mostly boring. There's only 1 rollercoaster ish ride, which is the space mountain. Its quite good but isn't really THAT exciting. I've tried better at less known themeparks. But objectively its enjoyeable, really.If you (or your kids) like the disney characters, it might be nice to see them walking around or buy the disney merchandise but as I'm not really a fan its no big deal to me.The queue cutting wasn't that bad. There are some people shamelessly walking past us to get to their friends who booked a place in the queue for them in front but you just have to put your feet down and tell them off. I had this person shamelessly saying  excuse me  when I blocked her way as she was trying to go to the front of the queue but its really not as common as some of the people here make it sound. There are probably such people everywhere, no reason to point fingers at mainlanders and say that they have no social etiquette.Some things that are well done include the 3D animation mickey show, forgot what its name is. Shall not reveal the reason why its so good, the surprise element is part of the fun. The fireworks performance at night is also really amazing.A recommendation   Go in the evening if you have to, the queues have eased up by then so you'll probably complete the same number of rides with less frustration than if you start in the day and spend most of the time in queue. And you won't miss the fireworks.",Disneyland_HongKong,9,park disnei ride disneyland time visit hong dai queue small peopl food hk kong wait
498,5631740,1,missing,United Kingdom,My advice to others Keep away its not cheap and not worth the money. Not enough rides and waiting time per ride are around one and a half hours. I was expecting something Magical:0 but Horror :() Trust me you dont want to on a 35C heat during the day with your little kids. If you are in HK I would recommend Ocean Park much more rides and much cheaper.,Disneyland_HongKong,9,park disnei ride disneyland time visit hong dai queue small peopl food hk kong wait
499,5615785,2,missing,Taiwan,"I visited HK Disney quite a while ago (Jan 2006). I was thoroughly disappointed but not enough to write a review. However, after reading so many positive reviews, I felt compelled to write one myself.Good   Not crowded; good layout; wide streets; clean; new; cheap compared to other Disneys in every respect   food, merchandise, tickets; landscaping immaculate; convenient to get to; multiple languages for guests.Bad   SIZE; lack of attractions, especially those that make Disney so fun and have made Disney so famous in America; people cutting in lines; people spitting; people sleeping on benches and bathing in drinking fountains; staff being too timid to do anything about obvious rule breakers.Okay, I am from America and grew up near Disney World in Orlando, Florida. I worked in Guangzhou, China for quite a while including the time of HK Disney's opening. Therefore, I was constantly getting news about the new Disney. Because I grew up near Disney World, Disney's defining characteristic to me is its size. It's huge! Let me list some facts so people can understand.Disney World   30,000 acres; 4 theme parks plus many others like water parks, campgrounds, outdoor parks, etc.; 24 resort hotels not including campgrounds; 99 holes of golf available; employee training center (large office complex); huge area with employee store.HK Disney   350 acres; 1 theme park; 2 resort hotels.Disney World in Orlando is less than 1 4 developed, yet still boasts all of those things. Animal Kingdom, one park, is 500 acres, which is still larger than the entire HK Disney building area. When you enter the Disney property limits, you drive for miles without seeing anything but trees and grass. Their size of the property is astounding. The parks themselves are also huge with too many attractions to finish in one day, especially if lines are long. You can park in one place and travel from park to park by monorail. From Disney's website:  If you wanted to stay in all the guest rooms in all of the hotels and resorts currently open on Walt Disney World property (at a rate of one per night), it would take more than 61 years. HK Disney is based mostly on Magic Kingdom, one of the four theme parks in Walt Disney World. Yet, it is less than half the size of Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom has 45 rides. HK Disney 22, and some of those are from other parks such as Animal Kingdom. Worst of all, the rides that are most popular at Magic Kingdom are not even in HK with Space Mountain being the notable exception.For quite some time before going there, I was told HK Disney is small. I was prepared for small. I was not prepared for microscopic. It's like a miniature Magic Kingdom. The castle is 77 feet tall. WDW's is 185 feet tall, over twice as tall. Main St is tiny. When we first arrived, we unknowingly walked from one end of the park to the other not understanding why we couldn't continue (took about 5 minutes). It was only after looking at the map that we realized we had already reached the end of the park.I do not agree with some of the other members on here that construction was great. I thought many things looked quite cheap. There were also a lot of things in rides that were downscaled quite a bit compared to WDW. Overall, I felt they cut a lot of corners with the park.Space Mountain is much smaller, but might actually be better. Lion King was much different, and also possibly a better show overall.I think the worst yet best thing for me was the Mainlanders. I speak fluent Mandarin and a little Cantonese so I could understand what was going on. The worst was the Mainlanders pushing through lines as if there were no other people there. They would spit, bathe in the drinking fountains, remove shirts and shoes and lounge on benches and sidewalks, spit, stare at peole like me who are obviously foreigners and make comments, etc. They couldn't figure out how to use the Fastpass machines and caused all kinds of problems in lines everywhere. They argued when they weren't allowed to cut in front of the legitimate Fastpass holders even though they themselves had no Fastpass. The undertrained staff was too scared to enforce rules for the most part.The best was the HK residents enforcing the rules themselves. At almost every ride, while waiting, an argument would break out between a HK resident and a Mainlander because of something the latter did. It was great to watch and made waiting in line quite fun.I think Disney did a horrible job planning this park. I think Disney was not prepared for the Chinese market and customers and not at all familiar enough with them from the beginning. I think the park misrepresents Disney to those that know nothing of its other parks. There have been countless news stories of administrative problems as well. Disney built its smallest park in one of the most densely populated areas in the world next to the most populous country in the world?!?! I just find it amazing that a company as big as this could make so many mistakes. To me, it all comes down to poor planning and not knowing enough about the local market. Too bad.",Disneyland_HongKong,9,park disnei ride disneyland time visit hong dai queue small peopl food hk kong wait
500,5435041,1,missing,Hong Kong,"Was there a month ago with my three kids   what a dissapointment. My kids' favourite rides in Disneyland Magic Kingdom is: Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Carribean. Guess what? They are not in this so called  Disneyland !!! Totally ruined their expectation. Ended up leaving the park early and decided to never return. We got a second day free since we were staing at the Hollywood hotel   kids does not want to return for a second day and we ended up in the hotel's pool instead. If you have been to other disney parks, dont bother with HK disneyland. If you have never been to one, save up and go to a REAL disney park like the one in the US or Japan. Even the Paris park is lightyears ahead of this one.Missing:: Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Small world, Star Tours, Peter Pan, Tom Sawyer, Snow White, Fantasmic and many more, oh, also no evening parade!!!Disney must think people in HK just like to walk around aimlessly in the park and not want to be in any attraction.

503,4589525,1,missing,Singapore,"What a waste of time and money. And to think I was planning on bringing by teenage kids. I went with a mate of mine who happened to be here at the same time. If you are over 8 years old, then there is nothing for you here. There is one roller coaster, Space mountain, that can only be described as LAME!!(my kids favourite word) with banked turns there are no G forces at all. And that my friends is it. Nothing else at all. No other rides that suit anyone over 8. The Dumbo ride is the next most thrilling ride and caters for anyone over the age of 2. Food is terrible. I just didn't eat in the end and I live in Asia so it isn't like I don't eat Asian food. The park is too small, the rides are hopeless, the food is awful, we didn't hang around for the fire works at we would have had to wait another five hours and we were sick of it by then.If you decide you have to go, a morning or afternoon will be enough. I am so pleased I didn't bring my 2 teenage boys from Singapore to HK and waste 2k on planes and hotels. they would not have been happy.One positive note, the park was nearly empty so very short queues.

I think there were more commercial stores or souvenir shops than the rides you can enjoy. They have to drop the entrance fee by at least half so people can appreciate the place and what they paid for. NOt worth visiting the place at the moment not until they upgrade it very soon.

505,4033897,1,missing,United States,"My husband and I took our 2 kids and it was the worst experience of our lives. Mothers take heed, you will be endangering the lives of your children should you bring them to this modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.First off, the park is poorly designed and incredibly miniscule. There are hardly any rides, and as you can imagine, with this few rides of course the lines are ridiculously long. Expect to wait 3 hours and more for even the worst of rides, though no  great  ones even come to mind. I truly believe that they built this whole park around the fact that it has Space Mountain and felt like it was enough to cheat their  ignorant  clientele into believing this is the real thing. This is NOT a real Disneyland, not the type I grew up with. This is at best an ultra mini version, and if anything, they should have made the ticket prices ultra mini as well because there is no way in hell the experience was worth the ticket price.But speaking of clientele, this may have been the worst thing about Hong Kong Disneyland. Before you think I am the squeamish type, my parents were in the Peace Corps and our family traveled all over Africa and South America. I grew up seeing decay and disease, and I can say I have never seen a greater cesspool of human waste and potential for the spread of disease as I did at Hong Kong Disneyland.My husband gagged and nearly threw up when he went for a drink of water to find feces in the drinking fountain.We saw a mother help her little boy with his trousers while he urinated next to a food stand.Smokers EVERYWHERE. Mind you, we're at Disneyland, not on the city streets where smoking in public is repulsive is enough. My husband and I nearly lost it when a man BLEW CIGARETTE SMOKE into the faces of our children!Mind you, we alerted Disney staff to these infractions and they DID NOTHING! It was unbelievable. It's like they were either very poorly trained or they were instructed to turn the other cheek.We found it irreprehensible. How park officials could let people smoke in public around children, blow smoke into children's faces, no less, and still consider themselves  kid friendly  is beyond us. Worst, this is DISNEYLAND! Yes, smoking everywhere is permitted at Hong Kong Disneyland.There were hundreds of other unsanitary and unsightly things that we encountered during our visit, almost too many to mention. We've never seen such outwardly anti social public displays ever in our entire lives. Wiping exposed underarms with bare hands and then smelling the hand, putting up bare feet everywhere on park benches and then rubbing and picking at the toenails, it was so disgusting. At times, you would think you were toiling away at some chicken farm instead of spending your holiday at Disneyland. The most shocking thing is that with the new outbreaks of bird flu virus predicated to happen any day now and possibly the re emergence to a more deadly and untreatable version of SARS, that there could be such horrid public sanitation and behavior at of all places, Disneyland!When you consider that SARS was originated in this part of the world from precisely this type of unsanitary behavior, and when you are among the 30,000 people packed into a space that is a third the size of Disneyland in the US, and people are urinating on the street and defecating in the water fountains, that you are in fact HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE to these type of diseases, whether it's SARS or H5N1 bird flu.What's more, Hong Kong Disneyland is like a hot box of second hand cigarette smoke for children. So either you are exposing yourself to the dangers of highly contagious fatal diseases brought on by unsanitary conditions and human behavior, or to preventable diseases such as cancer by inhaling second hand smoke when you visit Hong Kong Disneyland.Besides these factors, this place is supposed to be fun? Yes, but unfortunately, this place is as close as a family on holiday can get to the burning gates of Hell.

506,4020946,2,missing,United States,"The park is small. Tiny small.They say one of their selling points is that it's the first park built yet that is based entirely on the original park, but with an unlimited imagination this is the best they could come up with.There are only a few attractions. Like four major attractions, three show attractions and a handful of childrens rides.The train that goes around the park is not steam powered  it's electric with a smoke machine to create the  steam  coming out of the smokestack, and it only has two stations  Main Street and Fantasyland.In general, the park lacks character, ambiance and friendliness, the ride ops seem untrained and ambivalent, and I was surprised at how cheaply made it all seemed to be. In fact, several of the attractions felt like carnival rides in their queues and execution. The one thing that bothered me the most is that despite Hong Kongs weather (really hot in the summer and fall, cool in the winter and spring) the park seems unable to deal with it in a comfortable way. The queues are, for the most part outdoors, and there are no water misters or fans to deal with the heat. The food is inexpensive, however, and some of it is really good.The Jungle River Cruise is the best attraction in the park from a design sense, and they really tried to give it the detail it deserves. The finale is fantastic. The english version of the ride needs some ride operators who speak english well, because the jokes all fell really flat when there is no sense of timing or a punchline. The cantonese version was fantastic, and the operators were really very funny.Japan is just four hours north by plane, if you need a Disneyland fix, I would recommend Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySeas in Tokyo Bay instead.

So, not much to do for those craving excitement or thrills.There is no Pirates of the Carribean, no Big Thunder Mountain, no Haunted Mansion, no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Splash Mountain, no Peter Pan's Flight, no It's A Small World, no Star Tours, and no Autopia. Yes, you will find none of these attractions in Hong Kong Disneyland.There's also no Frontierland. What? Yes, Frontierland has been completely obliterated from the park, leaving only 4 lands: Main Street USA, Adventureland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland.
