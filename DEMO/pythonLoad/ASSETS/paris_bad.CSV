People that do not have that much to spend will be held back, because people with money obviously can skip the lines...absolutely ridiculous.Getting something to eat was horrible, again lines everywhere...just to eat someting right...And don't get me started on the staff, trying to figure out the amount of 3 icecreams with a small casio computer, and not being able to, or very rude staff. Only 2 ladies were friendly, have to be honest. All in all, very disappointing, long waiting lines, not being able to sit somewhere like a human being, and bad service.Our kids were so disappointed that they wanted to leave.We even heard people saying: 'Never again'.Absolutely not worth the money.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

2,669121201,2,2019-4,Switzerland,"We went to Disneyland Paris during the Easter break with family members who had come over from the States. As we had all experience Disneyland in Anaheim and Disneyworld in Orlando, perhaps our expectations were just too high. First off, the moving sidewalks from the parking lot to the park entrance were broken. Not a great first impression. Furthermore, there was a lot of gardening work ongoing when we arrived. Isn't Disney supposed to be magic, with everything looking in top shape and perfect? The security line moved, but was the first bottleneck. The second major bottleneck was to actually enter the park. As we had bought tickets online, we thought we would be able to enter the park fairly easily. However, there was pretty much mass chaos at the ticket check point, with many people jumping the queue and others just standing around. We eventually made it through and made our way to Fantasyland.We managed to ride a few rides, but when it came time to get on the Teacups, they had closed the ride. Not for the day, but for about 45 minutes to disperse the line. This caused many people just to loiter around the entrance, waiting for the ride to open again. Not great. We did manage to eat lunch  early  enough that we didn't have to wait a long time. However, the food that we got was not what we ordered. None of us had the wherewithal to go back and try to fix the order. so we just ate what we got. When it came time for ice cream, it took about 45 minutes just to get to the front of the line, and then another 10 minutes to process the order. This was because the staff at the counter were poorly trained, and only one person knew how to use the register, and others seemed like trainees. There were plenty of other foodcarts around the park that were empty. Not enough staff at the park to operate these. There were also plenty of rides (like Autopia and Dumbo) that were closed for renovation. Disneyland Paris does not carry the iconic felt mouse ears. We definitely won't be going back, and I can't recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone who is looking for a true Disney experience.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

They build the place years back and they are now just collecting cash without any effort, it does not compare in anything with the American parks which are truly amazing. The whole park now is designed to get money from their guests on every step without offering any services. The staff are truly miserable and seems like they hate their job. In the whole park there were no characters walking around at all so a kid can take a picture. There were 3 characters who a kid could meet in the whole park but you had to wait forever just to take a picture. Many rides where closed and the wait time for anything was 60 minutes or more, who in the world can make a a kid stand still in a waiting line for 60 Minutes or more?

We visited with our 2 grandchildren and entered the park just after the gates opened. Even then it was manic, probably too many people for the park to cope with.The story was Q,Q and Q. The worst was Peter Pan, the board outside said a 100 minute wait but this became an actual 127 minutes! The reason for this is Fast Pass. As a day visitor you are a third class customer. The pecking order starts with those who are on special deals in the resort hotels, then comes those who have paid even more money for Fast Pass. These people are able to queue jump leaving you to watch as they go to the front of the line. The Q situation extended to the catering facilities, even a coffee took 42 minutes. The guy was morose, monosyllabic and unhelpful. There were a number of these    solo    food stations around the site and all seemed to have the same issues.

5,667866575,2,2019-4,United States,"Having visited the Disney parks in both FL and CA in the states I have certain expectations of the Disney brand and parks and this park fell extremely short. From the initial unorganized entrance to the park to the lack of cast members available, it was a let down. Lots of areas in the park were under renovation while we were there, and there was nothing to make up for it. We were there the Monday before Easter and the crowds were terrible. And let   s add to the fact that visitors to this park will cut you in line and skip through the lines and not blink an eye, super annoying. They do this for all lines. We waited in line for Big Thunder mountain for 40 min only to be abruptly told to get out of line. Apparently the ride broke and that was it. No further explanation, no sorry, nothing. The very few cast members we encountered were unfriendly, unhelpful, and did not have any    Disney    magic. We love Disney and have been visiting the parks annually for the past 11 years. We would never go back to this park. ",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

At midday   the so called fast track was at 4 hours plus waiting time. And the food? Ofcourse also here endless queues and the menu still consists of pre made sad deep fried varieties of unhealthy fast food. Coffee? Don   t.

We were a family of 9 visiting Easter week, queue time for the rides were between 1   2 hours long, so in a 8 hour visit you only had 5 6 rides in total. In the US the Disney staff are more efficient, as one guest leaves the ride, the next is entering onto it, not something we saw here, staff very slow. We queued 45 minutes to buy an ice cream on Main Street, only one person serving, our daughter queued 30 minutes to buy a Micky Mouse key ring, again just one person serving in the gift shop. Quite a few of the rides not working, the main Disney train not available for the full 3 days we were there, the Dumbo ride also broken down for the whole 3 day visit.

8,667308717,2,2019-4,United Kingdom,"We decided to take our 6 year old for a long weekend. I must say we are very disappointed with the experience in general. Whilst I appreciate it was school holidays and the crowds were huge, I cannot see the value in paying so much for passes when actually you are likely not even to make it to 10 attractions over 2 days because of the queues. Some of the attractions were closed for renovation and others just look very tired and dated. The staff are poorly trained and for both days we were sent on a goose chase for our tickets because we had some vouchers. On day one we queued for over an hour!. We had downloaded the passes to our phones and one would expect that just like your plane ticket this should work at the barrier but no it didn   t! Leading us to queue at three different queues as none of the staff was trained enough to to know what to do. On the first day after what felt like endless hours queuing we were given tickets for    both days   , except this was not the case so the same drama the second day, another 70 minutes of queuing. This put us on a back foot for both days meaning we only had limited time and endless queues to endure before we could visit any attraction. The place is also VERY EXPENSIVE for the most basic things i.e. food I paid    37 or so for a meal of fries, a small bottle of water and a fish burger, 1 small portion of fries and 4 chicken nuggets. On day two we decided to leave the park and eat at one of the restaurants by he entrance. It was much more reasonable, it was proper food and peaceful. Merchandise is also cheap and tacky but EXPENSIVE!. We also stayed in a vacation club and not at Disney. This was a great choice away from all tack at Disney.The marvel attractions were ok but they had technical glitches and the queues horrendous. The parade was so busy the little 6 year old could hardly see anything. I know people were queuing since 4 pm for the 5.30 pm parade (what a waste of a day). Same with the fireworks we turned up at 9 ish to find a good patch but taller selfish people just walked in and stood in front of us again he couldn   t see much. I must add that not once did we see Mickey or Minnie except on the float or if we were prepared to queue for ages or book some silly breakfast (more money) with the characters. Why couldn   t they just have a few of these characters meeting and greeting children?. Their app is not very good and doesn   t give much info nor is it interactive enough. Information in general is sketchy unless you sit there planning for weeks. I think if you are a regular or know how to play the game you   d be ok. This is not a destination of once in a life time for a 6 yr old. There is no room for spontaneity. In general I felt we could have holidayed in Africa and seen real lions or the Caribbean and enjoyed the beaches for a better experience for the amount of money we paid. This was just a very tacky, dirty and over priced experience for very little return. I feel the place is so commercial (money, money, money)that the spirit of the magic is lost!

Previously visited other Disney parks in the United States and the gulf between the two couldn't be more obvious. A very dated, tired park with a few alternative rides, enough to entice you to visit but after your first day of broken rides, endless waiting in line for everything for little to no reward you realise you should have spent elsewhere and boosted some other economy. Park staff are all friendly, rooms are small but clean and if paying for inclusive meals, the food is more than adequate. Cultural differences not withstanding, generally unpleasant and nothing more than a poor substitution for an American idea which should have remained there or at least carefully selected a location where the concept of politeness and courtesy would not be lost.

Two weeks ago we visited Disneyland Paris for the first time, and it was the WORST!! Even though the park maps show  Smoking in designated areas only  they do not enforce this At.All. Outside of every restroom and restaurant you will find a clump of smokers, as well as anywhere you happen to walk. I realize that Europe is more comfortable with smoking everywherelet this happen? We would show a park employee a smoker and they would then walk right past without saying anything to him or her.At least half of the rides were closed for repairs or updates, and the restaurants kept running out of food, beer & ice cream! Disney calls their employees  cast members  and usually this is fitting based on the employees' energy levels & demeanor. Here, they should be called  employees . There was no excitement, no magic. We saw exactly one employee behaving like a cast member (a pirate outside of Pirates of the Caribbean ride).Our daughter hurt herself on one of the slides in the Pocahontas Playground, which already had a lot of broken slides.It is the worst reflection of the Disney brand I have ever seen.

It was so over crowded you spent all day shuffling along or waiting in a que. There wasn't actually that many rides there and quite a few of them were shut so the ques were horrendous on the open ones. Only managed to get on 3 rides. It really wasn't worth the money.

13,665271338,1,2019-4,United States,"I recently travelled to Disneyland Paris with my granddaughter and other family members. We stayed at a nearby hotel called Explorers which was ok, rooms were a bit small and the choice of food wasn't great but my granddaughter very much enjoyed the pool which had giant water slides. They had a courtesy bus which to you to and from the park which worked out very well. We had passes for both parks and started on the first day with the Disneyland Park. We found that quite a few of the rides were closed, most of the water fountains didn't work, most of the fast pass machines didn't work and the park was not really very clean. The staff seemed worn out, a bit surly and not very helpful, even the dancers in the shows were a bit lackluster. The only time we saw a Disney Princess was in the parade, there were queues for more than an hour to have your photo taken with a Disney character. Having visited Disneyland in Florida I expected the brand to shine just as much but the whole experience was very disappointing. I would expect Disney to reduce the price of admission to take into account the number of rides etc which were not working or closed for maintenance. Better still not admit quite so many people as they whole time was spent queuing. One time we queued for 40 minutes for a ride and it broke down just before we got on and the people who were on it were taken off using a step ladder. On average I would say you will spend 80% of your day in a queue. Walt Disney World is a smaller park with the same problems. The two saving graces were the parade and light firework shows. Definitely not the magical experience it should have been.

Other than the ease of getting to the property on the RER A line, there is very little to like about this subpar version of Disneyland. There are a much smaller number of    showcase    rides at this location, resulting in way longer lines than at US parks and an antiquated FastPass system that runs out of passes mere hours after the park opens for the day. The workers at this park were unhelpful and downright scornful or rude at times even for the most basic of questions. And the grounds sometimes had trash and cigarette butts laying around. You would never see that at any other Disney park. Finally, the size of strollers and backpacks allowed at this park are gigantic, resulting in some incredibly frustrating experiences as you try to navigate the park   s very narrow passage ways.

16,664022872,1,2019-4,United States,"As my daughter grew up in southern California we visited Disneyland California adventure many, many times, always enjoyed it. We also visited Disney World one time and had a great time with our park hopper passes. One time while in Tokyo on business in the 90s I found myself at Tokyo Disneyland during an extra day, it was also a fun experience, especially noting the differences between the comparable US versions of rides like Pirates of the Caribbean. So I expected something similar here, I was extremely disappointed. Let's start with the two parks, they are small, with the Disney Studios park being positively tiny. Add to this that many of the more popular rides are shut down for maintenance means there is very little for the throngs on people to do. Also it seems that a large part of Disney Studios is geared to promoting their Marvel franchise, with expensive toys on display everywhere. The rides that are unique to Disneyland Paris, like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, are awful. The Indiana Jones ride in Disneyland has a story, tied to the movies, that makes the ride fun. The Temple of Peril has none of that, it is just a (short) roller coaster that you would find at any amusement park with a temple facade. No tie to the movie at all. Super disappointing and super long lines. Smoking is banned except in smoking areas but this is ignored, people were smoking everywhere, including the lines where you couldn't escape it. The super cleanliness you would expect at Disneyland isn't there, with spilled food ignored on the ground, few cleaners in sight. If you are thirsty, try to find a drinking fountain, I didn't see one anywhere. Instead you need to wait in a long line to buy some water, or find a vending machine that isn't broken. Oh, and one more thing, we got on a Flying Carpet ride, kind of like the Dumbo ride (which was out of service). One of the cars was covered over with tape, it was broken. Some of the parts in our car were missing, too. I have never seen anything like this at any other Disney park. I guess Disney figures it can make money without worrying about these things, they have the only Disney park in Europe, but if you have tried the other parks, don't waste your time or money.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Getting there on the train was relatively easy. We only had one day   time for one park, so with a seven year old we chose Disneyland. We arrived right after the park opened and planned to stay through dinnertime. We gave up and left about 4:30. There aren   t a lot of rides to begin with, and several were closed including the train, Space Mountain, the cars, the Haunted Mansion, even the Swiss Family Robinson tree house. The only characters we saw were Donald Duck and the Genie from Aladdin. They were fixed in place with long lines, not walking around greeting people. Unless you pay an outrageous surcharge to get three Fastpasses in advance, Fastpasses use the old system where you get one at a time from a machine.

Firstly the cost of the tickets on the gate is EUR109 per adult, book online and with Attraction Tix and you'll pay   55 per adult   nearly half price!We arrived around 11am on Saturday 24th March and the ques to even get into the park was a nightmare. On man on a horse trying to direct everyone. You were herded towards and entrance and bags were checked before being herded towards either the Disneyland Paris park or Walt Disney Studio park.Once we were finally into the park we decided to try and head towards the back to go on some rides. We made it onto a small boat ride within 15 minutes which we didn't think was too bad. We should have gone next door to the little train ride straight away but we walked to Indian ride where we couldn't go on as little one was one cm too small. By now it was around mid day and after checking the app for wait times   everything was over 45 minutes wait. Some were already 90 minutes. We used the fast pass to get a ticket to return to Hyperspace mountain. We got the ticket around 12.30 and had to return between 3.35   4.05. When we returned we did walk straight on and was on the ride within 10 minutes.Everywhere you went, the lines were huge. To get candy floss we had to line up to purchase a ticket then line up again to collect the candy floss   this took over 30 minutes.The places to eat are all greasy fried food, no where healthy at all. There was also nowhere to fill up your water bottles so you had to line up and pay for a water. In the height of summer this could be very dangerous if you are dehydrated.Big Thunder Mountain was out for most of the day however we saw they were testing it and took a risk by standing in line and thankfully it paid off however we were still queuing for 30  minutes.There is no organisation for the shows and this resulted in a lot of crowding and the kids not being able to see a lot.The biggest issue here is the lack of staff. There was barely anyone around to help.Sadly we were caught up in the issues on Saturday night. We were locked in the restaurant for over three hours with two very scared children. It was disgusting the lack of information being provided and at one point we all had to climb under the tables and shied the children as there was rumours that a gunman was inside. You can not understand how terrifying this is.

That   s the magic of Disney disappearing kid strollers?! Reported it and they were so indifferent around us... go to city hall they said which was on the other side. Walked all the way to the entrance and not one security was to be found. Made it to city hall and the lady rolled her eyes and told us    it happens all the time    really?! Even handed us a    stollen pram    report! So Disney doesn   t try to fix a known problem all they do about it is a form with a Mickey logo! Brilliant!

Maybe it was the lacklustre live shows. Maybe it's because you have to make a reservation and queue to get a picture with any character. Maybe it was the over priced and poor quality food and merchandise. We ended up  killing time  in Vapiano restaurant the one place we found the food and coffee to be decent, rather than go back in to the parks. Most of the rides were mediocre at best.

However, the queues in this place were unreal. You expect to wait to get in ...everyone is likely to arrive as it opens etc. Its the rides...on the first day we managed 3 rides between 10am and 5 pm. 3 rides ...of which we queued for one for 2 hours. Normally, we would have just left but the children were there and once you commit to the wait, you are just too angry to leave the queue. That ride lasted 2.16 minutes ! More fool us. Food and drink onsite is costly and most bring their own. There are not loads of places to sit and eat it   most multi task whilst standing in the queues. Most staff were helpful apart from one who would not replace a broken pin badge fastening for my son who had owned it 30 minutes. No replacement fastener or offer of a refund just a non chalant    you buy another    . It   s a badge ffs, just take one off another badge and give us it   however, that staff member was not the norm   most were fine. Disney is obviously a huge enterprise, shops galore, over priced tat mostly unless you are die hard Disney of which we saw many. However, we wanted to do the old fashioned getting autographs of characters, meet characters for photos and there was very little of this. In two days in two parks we found one Goofy...both kids dissapppinted.In fact, far from being a memorable experience, both kids on the second day asked to go back to the village Nature accommodation to use the Centreparcs facilities.If we divided the cost of Disney between the rides we managed to get on (3 on day one, 5 on day two) then we have been sorely wripped off.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

34,657091974,1,2019-3,Switzerland,"Disneyland Paris managed a really difficult task: kill the Disney magic. I have been to several Disneyland parks around the world, including California and Japan and Paris is by far the worst. Let   s start with the good points: the park is clean, some staff are really nice, the light show and parades are up to Disneyland standards.Now the bad. First, the poor queue management and the huge waiting time. They advertise for an app but it is not working. All the waiting times shown in the app are wrong and hugely under evaluated, and never update. The staff if not evaluating and refreshing the queuing time on site either. The non working app and the randomly huge queeing time ( 30 min for its a small world! ) makes it really hard to plan your activities.Waiting time and queues are really a problem everywhere in the park. Be prepared to queue at toilets,restaurants, shops, everywhere. For instance, instead of having the Disney caracters walk around the park hugging children, they stay in one place and they make you queue (again) to see them. This is really disappointing for young kids.Would you queue an hour to see Mickey ?All the attractions in Fantasyland close really early at 6 pm. This is because of the lightshow at 7:30 pm  a really nice show, but it makes a really short day.All this would still be ok, provided the staff were all nice. Yes, the worst thing in this park is probably the staff. Not all of them, most of them are nice. However you may encounter some staff shouting at you angrily at any occasion. For instance, when preparing for a parade, instead of telling you nicely where you can cross they will yell at you      No, no     angrily. There is an italian restaurant in Fantasyland where they yelled at me and my 4 y.o. because we wanted to seat while my husband was queuing. A group of exhausted teenager nearby got the same angry yelling. Apparently you don   t have the right to rest and chill, everybody had to queue. When we were watching the parade, a staff member yelled at a nearby young couple trying to stand on a fence to see better. Instead of going there to tell them nicely that they couldn   t stand on the fence, the staff yelled at them angrily from far away, like they did something really bad . It scared all the people around and killed the nice mood of the parade. The random yelling and rudeness, and exhaustion from queues drained our energy. Disneyland Paris should train their staff in anger management and hospitality. They should properly manage their queues and have a functioning app. If you have the luxury to go to another Disneyland, avoid this one.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

What a disappointment everything that Disney achieves in the states is completely missing in Paris. Besides the huge lines for tickets and waiting ages because there was only 2 booths open. The whole park is missing that magical feeling. One attraction I went on the start was a typical host who describes what is about to happen etc. she asked for a show of hands as to who was English or understood English and although she said that   s most of you she then proceeded to do the show in French though she clearly had the choice.

Sign for Big Thunder Mountain stated 65 minutes when we joined, was extended to 75 minutes, then 85 minutes when we were stuck in the queue.

Was disappointed that several rides weren't working, including the Haunted House which we wanted to go on.Highlights were the Ratatouille ride and the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. The Star Wars show was good and the end of night fireworks were very impressive. Everywhere was clean, although people were smoking everywhere, including in the queues.

40,652866082,1,2018-12,United States,"Disneyland in the US is said to be the happiest place on earth, and it is. Disneyland Paris is like a knock off franchise that I can only assume is run by someone other than Disney. Where do I start:1. They closed off parts of the park starting at 7PM although the park was  open  until 10PM. Of course, they put up no signage and had not staff to direct patrons, so many people walked into section to find all rides and exits closed and had to wander around to find their way out.2. People were lining up for broken rides, but the staff (standing 5 feet way) weren't telling anyone that the ride was closed. The growing line caused major traffic jams. 3. We wait an hour for a ride that was then announced as  temporarily closed . It closed with us at the front on the line. Because we were next, we asked how long they expected the ride to be  temporarily  closed. Because it was 3 hours before park close, they told us that they didn't plan to even try to fix the ride. In other words, not temporary and no interest in fixing it. In all, we probably spent over 2 hours of our day waiting in line for broken down rides or trying to find our way out of closed sections of the park.4. Characters do not walk around the park as they do in the US, but you can stand in line for 90 minutes or more to see a character. We didn't; we were afraid that when we got to the front of the line, we'd be told the character was broken.5. There's a general lack of variety with the restaurants; restaurant staff aren't friendly at all; and many restaurants are far too small to provide seating for patrons and there's no public seating nearby. We were in a restaurant were people were fighting for tables, sitting on the floor, etc.6. The kids really wanted popcorn. We waited 20 minutes in a line that wasn't moving. I realized that it wasn't moving because their popcorn kiosks are manned by a single worker who both scoops popcorn (without gloves) using the same hands that take money and dispense change. I told the kids that they may as well go around and lick the hands of everyone in the part, if they're going to eat that dirty popcorn. Rack up another wasted 20 minutes standing in line. 7. And just to top it all off, when we finally left, it was impossible to find the exit. They wouldn't let us out the gates, we had to walk through a shop. Then some jerk employee was blocking the entrance to the train station and told us to walk around some gate while others were going straight through.Disney really needs to cut this bad franchise loose as it sullies their name.

However when we tried to use the fastpass there was no rides available until 17.00hrs which meant we were unable to go on any rides for over a 4 hour wait . There was a whole variety of rides closed which meant the ones that were working had over 1.5hr queues as all the people were concentrated on the rides that did work if you queued as there was no Fastpass available . Things closed even ran to basics like restaurants and toilets , trying to get lunch took over an hour queuing and the chose of places to eat limited in the park .All the adverts advertising Disney show the characters wandering around and interacting with the children , there was none of this which I feel is a misrepresentation of what you are actually purchasing, after all you are purchasing the Disney experience not just a theme park with rides. I do not need to travel to France to go to one of those .I did see two meet and greets with Donald and Pluto however we went to see Mickey mouse but he was not too be found . We did see Cinderella however, she rushed past not speaking to any one , was clearly in a hurry and it was not even midnight .We ended up leaving the park with an absolutely sobbing young girl whose magical dreams had been so badly broken .

This experience happened on Saturday 12 1 2019 . It also appears to me that you ONLY get the Disney experience if you stay in the Disney hotels ,otherwise no one appears to care that you are not getting what you pay for , this is something I also think should be made very clear from the start .Disney is a brand after all that is only as good as the people who are buying in to the magical dream , buying the merchandise ,going to the films. We the people who do that, should at least get the experience that we have paid for .Its like if you went to a Jeweller and paid for a diamond and was given coal .This is all such a great shame as so many people hold Disney on such a pedestal .I also have sent my complaint to Disneyland Paris guest relations on the 14 1 2019 ,i am yet to recieve a reply or acknowlegedement of my email .I would not recommend this park .",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

It is overpriced, overcrowded (do they even think about limiting numbers in busy periods? After spending over $1500 for tickets for the 5 of us, I had to spend an additional $1500 for one day of fastpass just to ensure we got ANY value from the parks. The food is overpriced rubbish, and (here I go again as an Aussie coffee snob) the coffee was atrocious. The limitations they place on the tickets and the outrageous queues (120 minutes was the max we saw on our days there in early Jan) mean it is almost impossible to get the full value from your ticket. There are so many other great options for things to do in Paris please don't waste your money like we did. Additionally, because of the additional expense of the food and fastpass we felt compelled to buy, our kids left with no Disney merchandise (partly due to the price and partly on principle). All I can conclude is that it has all been downhill for Disney in the past 20 years, or that Paris is a shadow of the Anaheim version. Finally, the park has a no smoking policy which is absolutely ignored by many of the visitors and is not enforced by the staff. This is supposed to be the  happiest place on earth , not a vector for lung cancer in children.My advice, if you MUST go:1. Take your own food and drink2. Buy a fastpass. Total rip off but your tickets are worthless otherwise You are paying to queue.3. Get there early   it almost always opens earlier than the posted time, in our experience.4.

We were there over the weekend in januari so not the busiest time of the year but waiting times for the popular attractions were well over a hour with a peak of 180minutes for ratatouille.

Well, the honest answer is that Florida is better in almost every way. Hands down. We had a good time in Paris, no question. But here are my two cents worth!Disneyland Paris is fun and easy to get to from the UK. Some rides are identical (Peter Pan, Dumbo, Buzz Lightyear...)   some are even better (Big Thunder Mountain). The Disney Studios are better (but smaller) than the Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and the village area is great. Nearby accommodation is cheap and it's well connected to Val d'Europe, one of Europe's biggest and best shopping centres.But it just isn't anything like as magic as Disney World in Florida. Both parks in Paris would COMFORTABLY fit into just Magic Kingdom in Florida, and even then there are some major flaws in the way the Paris parks run. Firstly, there are almost no meet and greets, which children adore. You have to queue for over TWO HOURS just to meet a Princess, which just isn't a good use of time or patience! This should be the easiest thing to provide compared to a whole new ride, so I don't understand why they don't do this. Secondly, the Fastpass system in Florida works brilliantly and allows everyone to try some of the signature attractions on every visit. Paris doesn't do this, with only a handful of rides offering a Fastpass, but you can't book it in advance like Florida, and they are severely restricted on numbers and time. This means the best rides in Paris have THREE HOUR waits, for two minute rides. You could spend nine hours in the park for six minutes of fun, which is ridiculous.If you're prepared to travel the distance, book hotels, buy   100  tickets for the day and NOT do the top activities   fine, but my guess is you'll leave feeling short changed. Don't get me wrong, you'll still have a good day, but you'll largely be consoling yourselves and your little ones with the fringe rides and chance encounters with any characters.Which brings me to the main problem. In Disney World, everything is spotless   literally not one leaf out of place. And the cast members are amazingly positive, polite, helpful and go out of their way to ensure you have a great time. They make your day, and it's truly magical. Disneyland Paris is dirty. Filthy toilets (and not enough of them), broken rides, lifts, escalators etc., litter EVERYWHERE (including floating in the water of Small World!) and the cast members are hilariously grumpy, surly and rude. Mostly they just completely ignore you and the children. They do like to bark instructions though!This isn't helped by the clientele who often spat on the floor (how is this a thing?!? Especially with kids around!?!) and smoked everywhere (even in indoor queues and rides) and will quite happily barge you, children and babies out of the way to jump the line.Everything in Florida is perfectly managed and the guests behave accordingly. There are six parks to choose from and you could be there for a year and not see everything there is to offer.Disneyland Paris is poorly run, and it's comes as quite a shock on your first day, if you've been to Disney World (and probably California and Shanghai too) before. I don't know whether it's the behaviour of the guests that makes the cast members so miserable, or whether there's not enough of them or adequate training, but you really have to not dwell on it and make your own fun if you want to get the most smiles out of your day.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

55,642773561,2,2019-1,United States,"Soo disappointed in my experience. :( I will preface this review by saying I am a HUGE Disney fan. Coming from the States as a frequent traveler to Walt Disney World and Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, I understand that the bar is set VERY high for Disney parks and attractions. When I first arrived to central Paris, our driver asked what we were doing. When I said our stay concluded with the New Years Eve party and stay onsite in Disneyland Paris, he told me that it was a shame because the parks in the USA are so much better and there are so many things to see and do in France. I laughed it off, but I now realize that he was 100% right. I had done 0 research beforehand as I had gone to Disneyland and Disney Studios several years ago, but my memory is vague. If I recall though, the Studios Park was a bit more fun. If you have a limited time in Paris and if you   ve been to other Disney parks, I   d recommend skipping this one. It does NOT compare to the parks in the states.We paid over $254 USD (over $120 per ticket) to attend the New Years Eve party last night and it was a total disappointment. First and foremost, entering the park was a total mess. The gate agents were totally lazy and allowed people to struggle fumble around with scanning the tickets. In total, it took us 40 minutes just to enter the park, it was an incredibly inefficient system. Unlike the parties or events in the States, nothing special or extra is included  you   re just paying a premium price to get in. The only exception to this is the parade, the parade was a special highlight reel of the best floats of 2018. This is a very nit picky comment but it would have been nice if the parade would have ended with a special float or something commemorating the party or New Years, it just seemed to end abruptly and wasn   t tied together. This was def the best entertainment of the evening  the performers were very enthusiastic. I think it was the only time I saw a smile from cast members all evening! The customer service at this park is absolutely atrocious and unacceptable. This has been a common complaint for years and they   ve done absolutely nothing to address it. 90% of the cast members look miserable at all times, they   re incredibly rude and abrupt, and a good majority stand behind the stores on Main Street chatting laughing while a few diligent workers are actually doing their jobs. It   s entirely mismanaged and poor. Part of the Disney experience is stellar customer service, when I pay a premium price, I expect to at least be treated with basic respect and a smile here and there. Many of the attractions were closed while we were there, and several of the few that were open closed at 10pm, which was unacceptable for the price we paid for the party. Especially since there was only one parade at 8:30, this forced people to choose between rides or the party entertainment. Fantasyland closed two HOURS before the fireworks so I didn   t even have a chance to walk through it. Both Frontier and Adventureland are not lit well at all, very difficult to see at night and very sparse. There isn   t the same attention to detail as there is at the US counterparts, it has really much more of a theme park vibe with the exception of Main Street USA   that is just as magical as any Disney park. Obviously all of the rides that were open had very long lines (otherwise known as queues) which is of course to be expected, it   s one of the busiest times of the year. I did not mind the lines for the rides  it is 100% to be expected. We only got to ride two rides, which was very disappointing but I am not surprised.However, the lines for absolutely everything was not acceptable as it takes away precious time from your day. Fast    casual    restaurants were incredibly inefficient and slow. We waited over 40 minutes for a hot chocolate, which just wasted the precious minimal time that we had during the party. They closed down several restaurants and only had a few open; yet I saw dozens of people SEATED eating their meal on the floor of the fast casual establishments because there was nowhere for them to sit! This is shameful, if you can   t accommodate the ticketed number of guests you need to open more establishments. I   m assuming DLP is severely understaffed. The restrooms were completely disgusting. I   ll spare you the photos, but there was toilet paper strewn about everywhere, a complete mess. You would never see this at WDW or Disneyland Anaheim.The castle illuminations and fireworks were quite good, very magical. The countdown to midnight was a bit underwhelming, the free party at the Village looked more fun.I   ve heard that Disney is going to invest over a billion dollars to make this park better. I certainly hope that is the case. Maybe I will return then. For now, I would not waste your time in Paris if you   ve had the opportunity to experience other Disney parks. If you haven   t been to Disney and don   t foresee a trip to the US anytime soon, I   d recommend going on a non peak day, and certainly not for any ticketed event like New Year   s Eve. I say this through a very critical lens because I travel to Disney parks frequently  IF I lived in Europe and didn   t have the opportunity to travel to the states, I   m sure I would still come to this park and enjoy it for what it is   just would never come back for New Year   s Eve or during any peak seasons, they   re clearly not equipped to handle it well. I am so disappointed after spending $250  for tickets, $330  for an on site hotel, and an exorbitant amount on expenses, that the party was so lackluster.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We then found a driver who managed to get 4adults,2 children and all our luggage in his normal size estate car which was such a squeeze! It then took us 1.30hours to get to the hotel Cheyenne which we were quoted 80    at first but ended up costing us 125    due to traffic!We arrived at the hotel Cheyenne at approx 11am where I was    welcomed    by a hotel receptionist who just gave me some cards with our names on and a flyer for the park.She didn   t didn   t explain that these cards were to be used for food and getting into the park. We were then told that we couldn   t get in our room till 3pm so we left our luggage in the luggage room and jumped on the shuttle bus to the the park which literally took 5minutes.After a stressful morning we happened to catch the Christmas parade in all its full glory!Food at the park I booked the premium food package before we went and booked all the places we wanted to go.If we didn   t do this the food in the park was ridiculously expensive especially in the silver spur where it would have cost us 280    for 2 adult and a child   s meal!The food was amazing especially enjoyed Walt   s,silver spur and the character tea in inventions! Book your reservations before you leave as so many families we spoke to didn   t have anywhere to go to eat!Buffalo bills is a must see! I don   t like horses but absolutely loved this show!even my 20month old sat and watched the whole thing!Dont forget your beers are free when your having your meal.Shuttle bus this was fine in the mornings but the park shut at 6.30 on the Wednesday and Thursday nights which was hell! We literally had to fight to get the buggy   s on to the bus no one would move especially the locals!The rides are amazing but aren   t as many as I would have thought there would be. I was also shocked how many my youngest (20months) could go on.The characters you must download the lineberty app before you go to the studios as you will not get chance to see any of the characters.This gives you a ticket to come back and visit but you only get one per person!Workers the workers at Disney mainly on the main entrances spoiled our whole Disney welcoming experience they were rude, miserable and just didn   t want to work there!Totally different to the workers in Florida and Disney cruise!We were shouted at to show our tickets,told to move out the way abruptly and generally disrespected which really upset me! I have vowed that I would never go back due to the sheer lack of respect! I would rather save hard and go to Florida and get the    whole    Disney experience rather than just a taste!

60,642464060,1,2018-12,United Kingdom,"I remembered going to Disney when I was younger so thought it would be a great idea to treat my family to a world class theme park holiday.Let   s start with the Eurostar; I booked premier class and it was a great train that was very modern. The downside was no hostess service, Wi fi was appalling and the meal consisted of a piece of bread and a croissant. No Joke!The Disney express service was superb and worked really well enabling us to get straight into the park when we arrived which was great.Entry into the park was fine but the signage was awful. Trying to find how to get around with out a map is impossible. People walk around smoking or vaping everywhere in the park to the extent where I feel like I have become a smoker. A resort that is for children and allows people to smoke freely which basically sends the message to kids that it   s ok to smoke is appalling.Trying to get food is ridiculous at the fast food joints. You would think that they would be ahead of McDonalds with the digitised menu but no, old school queues and no where to sit. Price 3 times more than McDonalds or and the quality is 3 times as poor.Queuing for rides is also a joke, they need to let less people in. Queuing for over 2 hours to get on rides is a joke in this day and age.Next is your hotel, we stayed at Newport bay and check in was poor, I wasn   t asked about having extras on my room so when I ordered from the bar I couldn   t charge to to my room. It took the person at reception 10 minutes to sort this out. The alcohol is a rip off,   8 for a pint and   16 for a large glass of wine and that was house. Sancerre will cost you   22.We upgraded to the compass club and breakfast was good as well as the hot drinks and cold drinks in the fridge. But unless your kids like pop there are no bottles of water in the fridges to take with you. The food in the evening is also poor, there are miniature sandwiches filled with various pastes. They can   t even afford or be bothered to to put some meat in the sandwiches or serve some hot food. Again another poor value for money experience.The restaurants in the park serve good food but it is over priced. I had a steak which cost   35 and it was so small I eat in 3 bites. The kids menus are poor in all the restaurants we went too which was captain jacks and the silver spur. I wish we had just eaten at McDonald   s or earl of sandwiches. Both are well priced and you don   t feel like you have had your pants taken down.The Disney photo plus app is also good in principal but again downloading the photos is hit and miss and we lost loads. Great idea though if it works 100% of the time.Character breakfast,   113 to queue up for a buffet, spend 10 minutes queuing for a coffee and get 6 pictures. For that kind of money I expect a character to at least sit with us and to get someone to serve my coffee.We also noticed that a lot of things looked worn out. For example lighting McQueen car had all the stickers peeling of it, a drinks vendor had a cabinet with fake ice cubes in it and green algae was growing up the side of it.Lastly the train in the way back was terrible, ripped seats, no Wi fi, didn   t take card as payment and the meal was a slice of quiche. Awful, again why can   t you at least give people a sandwich.Overall a poor experience and a waste of money. Not what I remember from my days as a kid at Disneyland Florida. I remember there being characters everywhere, you didn   t need to queue up to meet them. The staff where really friendly and helpful. There were lots of vendors selling meat on the bone or french fries etc. Here you just got someone selling you a small cinema popcorn for   7.I will never go again or recommend anyone go unless they don   t care about money and love Disney.

So we went into the big eating   souvenir hall and the people were sitting on the floor, as there was not enough place to sit outside inside to have once's lunch?!? I was amazed what I saw there.

This is apparently a 5* hotel. On arrival we had to check in, there were 5 check in desks and only 2 of them actually manned resulting in long queues, after waiting for over half an hour we were finally given our room keys. The room itself was fine if a little tierd. Both the room and bathroom were acceptably clean. There were tea and coffee facilities but after using the kettle once it broke and was not successfully replaced in spite of frequent requests. The food in the hotels restaurants was appalling. The breakfasts were ALL cold, piles of food of all kinds sitting on a counter with just a couple of small infra red lamps to supposedly keep it hot. In fact all the food in the hotel was uneatable. Our daughter, son in law and children stayed in the same hotel but in the more expensive Castle Suites a month previously, again they found the quality of the food uneatable. After this we decided to eat, instead, in the park. We had to queue at every single place, in McDonalds the queue was over an hour long, the other restaurants were no better, there was also nowhere to sit down as they were all so crowded. As for the rides attractions, queues again were over an hour long, sometimes two. Children we   re miserable, crying and moaning standing in these huge queues. We had fast track but only one of the attractions we wanted to visit had the fast track facility. Disney put on a fireworks display on the lake. This was a complete waste of time as everyone was herded to a place that had a huge globe in front of it completely blocking everyone   s view, utterly ridiculous. On the third day it rained heavily so we bought macs, yet again the queue was over half an hour long with only two tills working.On the plus side once we did manage to enter the attractions they were excellent, and all the Disney characters utterly charming, the shows were excellent with very talented performers, it   s such a shame that all of that was ruined by the rest of it.

Well it was pretty crowded anyway, most of the waiting times were between 30   60 minutes. I cannot imagine how it is in summer. We didn't manage to meet the princesses or mickey and didnt ride Pinocchio as these were 60mins  of waiting at all times and we just do not love waiting in lines. Must be even worse for children. What was really disappointing is the number of breakdowns, not only Phanton manor and the raiload was closed for refurbishment but during the day Buzz and Thunder mountain broke. We had FPs for those so we just had to throw them away.As for the disney characters there is not many at all, good luck meeting them. Except for the parade where you can see them for a few seconds.As for the staff, they did not smile at all so it seemed like they were not enjoying their work at all. As for the food there were not many lines but the food for the price was disgusting. When I buy loaded fries for 11 eur I would at least expect real guacamole, same goes for a 6 eur hot chocolate, it was just cocoa in water with a lot of sugar. I would definitely not allowed my children to eat there. The merch was also pretty overpriced (2 eur for a postcard or 10 eur for keychain?).The christmas decoration was also pretty disappointing tbh, there were some lights ans a christmas tree on the main street but not thaz much decoration around.

I was told as a disabled person I could secure a 10% discount for myself, a free carer ticket and the children would be full price and we would get queue assistance. All this seemed very fair and generous but I was told we would need to buy the tickets at the park to secure this discount and access card. When I asked how to buy the tickets they said we needed to go to the Donald Desk on arrival! I suggest this should be re named the 'Donald Desk of Doom!' Pre trip I asked if I could reserve a chair for the day    No sorry, all our chairs are on a first come first served basis.  (was the response!) I couldn't take this risk so we bought one in a charity shop and took it with us. On the day we arrived at the Donald Desk, queued for 30 mins only to be told we were in the wrong queue! Apparently, we were in the service queue NOT the disabled queue! We then queued for another 30 mins in another queue which we were told was the right queue... only to be told they could not sell us the actual tickets only provide the access pass and we would need to join another queue to buy our tickets! There were only three queues to choose from all with 100's waiting,..... there were 20 desks unstaffed, we had to queue at one of the three desks for a further hour to buy 400 Euro's worth of tickets... we had arrived at the park at 10am .... if the signage had been better and the staff more helpful we could of started in the right queue... my children were in tears.... my son called it the queue of doom and said lets just go to lego land next time mummy.... There were families with autistic kids who didn't understand why we were not being allowed in the park... it was a truly miserable experience for everyone ...Once we were in the park the system worked well but the purchasing of the tickets was rude, disorganised and ridiculous....

This again, reinforces my opinion that all they are interested in is making money.The cost of food at the resort is extortionate and they are in the dark ages when it comes to dietary requirements or vegan offerings, which were non existent.I would have to think seriously about visiting again and could only recommend staying at the Disney Hotel,( where we had previously stayed) which gives you various privileges but costs a great deal more than the other hotels.In fact, you could have a family holiday in a four star hotel in Spain for two weeks compared with three days at this resort.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
85,631059870,1,2018-11,United States,"Okay, so we made the mistake of going at a peak time, over the Toussaint school holiday break, and that is on us. But I really don   t think our experience would be all that different with smaller crowds at an off peak time. The place is just poorly thought out, under staffed, and not well managed. In face of the disappointments of the day that just kept coming, my husband and I remained upbeat, trying to make the best of it especially for my son   s sake. He is only seven years old and this was his first time to a Disneyland. But it was a hot mess. After ten hours and 230 euros, we got ride two rides and found it nearly impossible to find any food to buy while we were there.Luckily, we are living in Paris right now so we didn   t waste a precious day of some shorter vacation in France on this. But there are so many better options for spending a day with your kids in the Paris region. Please heed my advice and that of others here and don   t waste a day of your life, a wad of money, and your time on this depressing place. After we arrived, it took at least twenty minutes to clear security.We pre purchased and printed our tickets (230 euro for two adults, one kid). Like at security, the park entrance wasn   t so much comprised of    lines    as much as five or so sites of chaotic masses of densely packed people. With no other info, we finally joined a very, very long line, that seemed more orderly that the crush of humanity elsewhere. We were unsure we were in the correct line with the kind of tickets we had. Everyone around us was equally confused. It was chaos. There was ONE poor flustered employee, working this entrance doing the best he could...trying to process the endless line through the high gate and turnstiles, while also having to try to answer people coming up and shouting questions at him over these barriers trying to find out if they were in the right line. If that wasn   t enough, this guy also had to leave his post frequently to let disabled park goers in through another gate some distance away. While we were waiting to enter the park numerous disputes broke out over people line jumping, which was rampant. Some of these interfaces verged on out and out brawls. It took over 40 minutes to get into the park via that line. Once inside, we saw another massive line at the    City Hall    the    customer service    spot which is also the site where disabled visitors get the passes allowing them special access they need to the rides. It is really sad to see disabled adults and children, many of them in wheelchairs, waiting outside in the cold, no doubt for over an hour or more. The lines for rides were a lot more sedate than the crush outside, but even longer. They all clocked in around 1.5 or 2 plus hours wait per ride. We heard people with FastPasses complaining of slots not being available and long wait times as well. We spent our day in lines and only got to go on TWO RIDES ALL DAY LONG. The Disney app which is supposed to help you navigate the park and get updates for wait times for rides was worthless and 9 times out of ten did not respond or post any wait times at all.Food is another huge problem. It is close to impossible to buy it, even if you are totally willing and ready to pay inflated amusement park prices. Any food purchase involved negotiating massive chaotic    lines    and hour long or more waits. Several restaurants, inexplicably, were closed completely. There are not enough    fast    food outlets in the park, not even for low volume days. After standing in another chaotic line FOR OVER AN HOUR from 2pm to 3pm, I finally purchased 3 plain hotdogs, 3 fountain drinks, and 2 fries for 46 euros.  The employees at the food places really were doing the best they could. They were professional, cordial, and working as fast as they could in the face of endless, daunting lines and frustrated, hungry, sometimes even angry clients. Clearly behind their strained cheery smiles they were miserable, and who wouldn   t be? It was really depressing. I felt bad for them, and upset that I had given money to a company that treats both its customers and employees this way. Stores selling overpriced Disney merchandise, however, can be found throughout the park and, while crowded, are staffed so that visitors can make purchases. I guess selling merchandise makes Disney more money than providing park goers with something (anything) to eat. If you do go, pack your own food, everything your family will need to make it through the day. There is clearly something really wrong with Disney corporate culture that things have sunk this low. My husband and I had been talking about about making a trip to one of the US Disneyland parks, complete with a stay in one of their one site hotels or maybe even taking a Disney cruise. A trip to Disney has been such a rite of passage in the past. But after this experience, anything Disney related, anywhere in the world (my husband and I for once are in complete agreement) is off the table.On our ride back home, my son told us he had an    ok    time (I think he didn   t want us to feel bad knowing what we   d done to get there), but he also said that he didn   t really want to go back to any Disneyland again. It is only an amusement park, after all, and our crummy day there isn   t a tragedy or the end of the world, but I do feel the same way as my son.

Once past security you have to walk through the Disneyland hotel which as it was raining the floor was extremely slippy and unsafe dangerous, we saw no signs telling people to be careful due to the floors and even saw someone fall and hurt themselves as a result of the water.Once up to the main entrance people were trying to use rfid cards that don   t work very well (not like Florida which has magic bands which we have never had problems with).

Once in a queue there is no way to go to the toilet, drink water or seat anywhere. Awful.

93,630067208,2,2018-11,United Kingdom,"Myself and my partner have dreamt for years of coming to Disneyland Paris together for Halloween. We are a young hard working couple and saved for over a year to be able to afford our dream trip. We booked the full Disney package in August 2018 (flights, magical shuttle, hotel, park tickets and full board dining plan) and couldn't wait to arrive for Halloween week.The problems started the second we landed at Paris CDG Airport when our not so  magical shuttle  bus was no where to be found. After waiting an hour outside the airport at the shuttle stop, we decided to ring the hotel (Disney Santa Fe) to find out where it was. It was only at this point we were informed that the shuttle stopped at 8pm (which makes me think why did they allow us to book and pay for this, knowing our flight arrived after this time). The hotel assured us they would fully refund our taxi when we arrived   which cost 64euros. Turns out we had to file for a refund request which can take 15 working days to get a response from. As we were on the full board dining plan, we only brought 80euros with us as extra spends for shops etc. This therefore left us with 16euros for the next 4 days.It was 10pm when we arrived at our hotel. Luckily the canteen was open until 10.30pm, so we were able to pop in for a bite to eat with our dining plan. When checking in, we were told all blocks had coffee and vending machines, however once we got to our room, they were all 'out of order', and remained that way for the entire stay.On our first morning we decided to visit the Disneyland Parc, all in all we had a fairly enjoyable day. However the hyperinflation of guests was unbareable to say the least. Queue times were ridiculous, with some being up to 90 minutes long for a 2 minute ride. Throughout the day me and my partner ate exactly the same meal until the evening when we ate at the Hukuna Matata restaurant. I had the meatballs, and he had chicken strips. All seemed fine at the time until the next morning when he became incredibly ill, from what seems to be minor food poisoning. This set us back for our entire 2nd day (Halloween).In the evening of Halloween, my parter decided some fresh air might do him some good, so we headed down to the Disneyland Parc to try and enjoy the halloween party   the one thing we came to experience. Once we got to the gates we showed our Magic Pass, only to be DENIED ACCESS! Not once were we informed that this was an additional expense and we could not enter the park without a prepaid wristband. We were then forced to spend the entire evening sat in our hotel room.We can't comment on the price of food as we were full board, however we have seen many families have to pay out over 80euros for a few sandwiches and drinks.We haven't had any issues with the staff, and were actually susprised at how accomodating they are to English guests. We are writing this whilst sat in the hotel room on our 3rd day. We did go into the Disneyland Parc this morning however we just had to leave due to the amount of people they had managed to cram in through the gates. There was no chance of getting on any ride without having to queue for over an hour in the rain. We even had to queue to leave the park!All in all it feels that the individual is not valued in Disney anymore.

Turned out not only to be half term in the UK but also in Holland and France so the park was understandably full. Nevertheless, at least three major rides (key ones you looked forward to) were out of action (technical problems. renovations etc  why, during the busiest time?). Queuing times were anywhere between 60 and 90 minutes. On one full day we actually managed to get three attractions in, despite having purchased Fastpasses (the Fastpass option is a waste of money, it does not work and shouldn   t be on offer). The rides for smaller children were also affected by large queuing times (ok it was half term), however waiting for 40 minutes for a one minute ride is ridiculous. The turnaround times between these rides was longer than the rides themselves. Queuing times to to see the Disney characters was 2 3 hours each but we toughed it out for the sake of the children. Hardly any seating availability in the park, and when, only for smokers. Water fountains to refill bottles hardly available. Toilets generally filthy.

I am actually ok with the high prices as I honestly expected to pay extra for the experience. What is unacceptable is the waiting for everything..as other guests mentioned you literally cue for everything.

But now Disney have said to upgrade we would have to pay a cancellation fee and rebook at today   s prices which is significantly more than when we booked just so she can access the toilets which is a basic human right . As for Euro star they are unable to help as the booking is though Disney not them .All they can do is let the driver know so he can check on us .

The crowds really marred the experience for me. Compared to the previous day at Walt Disney Studios, which was not as crowded, this was much less fun. At the Studios, the weather was overcast, so perhaps that played a part, but in general the studios is less crowded than the main park, I believe. In the studios, you can book to see characters online via the Lineberty app, which has its problems, but we managed to book three character visits with it. In contrast, you have to queue in DLP park to see the characters. We queued for over an hour to see Aladdin and Princess Jasmine in the searing heat. On to the queues. The big rides had queues of between 1 2 hours. Big thunder mountain was over 2 hours at one stage. Even the small rides had long queues. It   s a small world was 45minutes! Now imagine standing in the blazing hot sun for an hour with irritated kids for an hour, queuing for a 2 minute ride. It   s madness. Disney really need to limit the numbers coming into the park. I know we came in the summer holidays, but I didn   t think it would be this bad. Even just walking around the park was a challenge   it was so busy.

Also it seems that if you hold one priority ticket for a ride which you can go on in 3h you cannot print another one! Hence I would say the only thing priority pass lets you do is to queue for majority of the time 'outside of the queue'. Not a great value for money.

129,615064889,1,2018-8,United Kingdom,"I was absolutely appalled with how poorly this place is managed! They oversell their tickets resulting in the park being so beyond overcrowded to the point of it being a health and safety risk of suffocating! The density of the crowds was a particular nightmare for me as I am a highly sensitive person who gets really panic stricken being in crowds usually, but this was on a whole new level from the usual crowds I've had to suffer with before! They clearily oversell their tickets instead of setting a limit to the amount of people that enter the park and controlling it, as like I mention crowds are beyond abysmal and you wait in queues for rides for 1 hour and a half, so long that by the time you're done there you've only gotten round 2 or 3 rides. Not only that but literally whenever we went to one of the restaurants there to eat there were endless queues which were moving verly slowly, which was also the same for whenever you wanted to get a drink from a cart truck or something, which is so impractical and wrong when it's something essential like food and drink that you need. I mean yes it was peak season being the end of August but I still think there should of been some control over the crowds queues to make things more accessible, like not overselling their tickets.Something that really infuriated and disgusted me was when we were in the studio park and there was a sudden rainstorm, we were queuing outside the theatre place to see a show there where there was such a dense crowd to say the least, mostly due to the fact it was raining and people were trying to shelter, that there was an actual risk of suffocating as there was not control or structure of this crowd. I was infuriated and disgusted by the fact that there were no staff controlling this crowd, to say for instance that there were too many people and this crowd was all too unstructured and out of control and getting rid of lots of the people nearer the back, but instead they made the crowd worse by asking people who were just sitting down out of the queue to shelter from the rain to get up and join the queue, not the back of it but beside the people who were already at the front, despite the fact they were outside the barrier and people outside the barrier are not allowed to join the queue, so they were basically breaking their own rules! It was disgusting, they didn't do anything to control the extremely dense crowd, instead making it worse, and just stood there apathetically, letting the crowd go denser and denser making people wait for ages.

We made our way to the Thunder Mountain ride. By the time we reached it , it was already a 45 minute wait. Next we made our way to the Indiana Jones ride. It was closed due to technical problems. Over to the Hyperspace Mountain, to find it closed. Back to Thunder Mountain, where it was now a 75 minute wait, so we tried our luck at Indiana Jones again. Still a technical problem, but luckily resolved soon after we arrived. On to the Pirates, where we waited an hour. Back to Hyperspace Mountain, but still down. After four hours in your park we had managed only three rides!Your fast pass was virtually useless, as the times quickly extended so far that closing time would probably have arrived sooner.We decided to try Thunder Mountain again, and after more than 60 minutes of waiting, when we were within sight of boarding, it developed a  technical problem , and we all had to be  evacuated . When I asked a member of staff what the problem was, and how soon it might be resolved, I was told that the problem was that the guests were not entering and leaving the ride quickly enough, and that this had caused a shut down. So your  technical problem  was our fault! An hour of waiting for absolutely nothing. The waiting time on this ride, when it started again, ran out to 115 minutes: and that was the optimistic figure on your sign, which all invariably underestimated the actual waiting time! The  fast pass  time was already showing 9.30pm.On our fourth visit to Hyperspace Mountain we did actually find it operating, and managed only a 45 minute wait as individual riders. No second ride though, because it soon was out of action again. We did manage a second trip on the Pirates ride, and another three on Indiana Jones, before finally giving up as 10.00pm approached. So in 12 hours, with no break for refreshments, we had achieved a grand total of EIGHT RIDES. That's roughly 90 minutes of our time for each three or four minutes of entertainment.My daughter commentated that much was made of the  girly  princesses, but little of the less stereotypical ones (Moana, Mulan and Pocahontas), and very little in similar vein for boys. She wanted to visit the Pocahontas play area to see what it was like, but it too was closed, for no obvious reason. We tried to use the railway, but it closed early.Either you need to admit fewer guests, or provide more landmark rides, and seriously reduce the amount of down time due to technical problems. At present I could not recommend Disney Paris to anyone, and feel that the experience is very poor value, not just for money, but also of our time.Regards,RESPONSE: NONE",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

When we got there we went to studios because they close more earlier and we got there when it opened so we wanted breakfast... 45 minutes it took to get a drinks and a meal!! The queues were ridiculous and there needs to be more signs to toilets and stuff. In the daytime aswell it seemed so busy that one of the rides broke down aswell... we went and spent 2 hours waiting for the shell nemo ride thing and I hated it! There needs to be more rides which have fastpasses because there were only like 3 rides which had them and they were shut!! Last thing about the studios is that we went to magic kingdom to see the parade and stuff then we went back to studios cuz I wanted to do some sorta drawing and they had no wait times and they closed 2 hours before studios closes! People were dead rude aswell by not saying thank you and pushing around. We went to the eiffel tower after and no one was like that... kinda a rip off how it's do expensive aswell... When it hit dusk it wasn't as busy so we went to its a small world and it was perfect for me and small kids!!! There need to be more of that stuff... I'm in that situation that I'm too old for kids stuff and too young for the proper rides... all of france in fact was a rip off cuz in the airport all the vending machines were not working and just took our money!!! It was awesome walking through a cave with a dragon and another retelling aladins story in adventureland at night. Magic kingdom closes at 11pm and doesn't tell us it starts the firework show then aswell... we needed to go like 10 mins after if started to get the last bus to the hotel... we waited 1 hour for this and there needs to be more fastpasses and more information about things!!!,Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Everything, and I mean everything is geared towards taking your eyes out and pissing you off and creating suffering. I   m not going to slag off any of the cast members for being rude as I didn   t see any of that.My issue was to do with the experience itself. There is no way that the park is geared toward children at all. If it was, the process for getting your kids on a ride would have been better engineered or managed. The times for the display at night would have been more focused for small kids too. 11pm for the Final closing show and kids sitting on concrete for 2hrs before to get half a good view. No good got my 2 small children.It was incredible to experience to watch parents making small their children wait for over 60  min for a 30sec Peter Pan ride.I seen 3 4 years olds lying on the floor looking exhausted in the longest queues I   ve ever seen. Tantrums, crying and arguments between couples. It is all well and good getting a fast pass if you want to go on one of the rides for older kids (p.s they don   t work as well as you would expect.) But none of the rides for small children who are a lot more exposed in every way to tiredness etc are organised that way. We went for a fast past for one of the rides at 10am in the morning and was giving a time at 10pm that night to return... bare in mind we now couldn   t use that fast pass entitlement until we had been on that ride. Effectively wiping out any point in having one. They don   t tell you that you have to queue for absolutely everything.We queued for 40min in our hotel when we got dropped off just to get our room.We then queued for 25min to try book tables for restaurants over the next few day... to avoid queues.Then we queued for our photo passes for ages. Remember we haven   t even left the hotel yet and we had been queuing for over 2hrs. Expect to queue for any toilet Expect to queue for any food (which is terrible)Expect to queue for park accessExpect to queue for every rideExpect to queue for every single thing.The majority of our trip was standing in a queue. I honesty don   t understand how anyone can justify this as being a positive experience. This may sound obvious but seriously it   s something to consider. 95% of the spoken language on the attractions etc is in French. Now this may seem silly that I mention this but my little 4 year old girl loves marvel. The shows and experiences etc were predominantly in French. I could see how much she was gutted by not really understanding what was going on.The closing show at 11pm. Most of the Disney songs are sang in French. Yes there is the odd English songs and narration on rides but trust me.. you better brush up on your French $77 for an adult meal (for example) in the park so plan ahead for snacks and drinks.What I will say is that the magic bus and all the shuttles worked amazing. They were very dependable and just worked really well.I will never go back there as long as I live (Paris). I should have took my friends advice and gone to Florida. Next we try it we will not try to cram in all in 3 days and take 2 weeks with a villa. Take our time and go when the littles ones are older. All this can be boiled down to poor planning, wrong time of year from us as parents I must admit... but at the end of the day an expensive like this which should be positive and enjoyable shouldn   t be so forced.Bare all this in mind when your thinking about spending   2k  for a long weekend in Paris.Save your money and go to America and do it properly.

However the park was packed full of people. It was way overcrowded and obvious that the park wasn't designed for such a huge amount of people.Everywhere you went it was packed. Not just in the queues for the rides, but EVERYWHERE.The queues at the rides where endless. The least attractive rides where at least 45 minutes.

Seriously, the food options in the park are limited to junk and very few restaurants cafes were open, even on a Saturday. On a Saturday, at 18:00, the large cafe by Space Mountain had two lines open... during dinner. Oh, one line was cash only and the other credit with no signs posted. (2) Prepare kids for disappointment temper expectations. This park    looks Disney great    but many rides were out of order. On August 18, Thunder Mountain closed from opening until 15:00. Pirates shut down after waiting an hour in line. Space Mountain, Tower of Terror were down for at least two hours. Haunted Mansion was closed. The Indiana Jones ride might actually be the worst ride I have ever gone on. Not exaggerating: There was nothing even close to relate it to Indiana Jones. It is a very painful coaster that circles around a poorly decorated temple. That   s it. There aren   t that many rides in the park, so you wonder what you are paying for.With that said, Pirates, Ratatouille, Crush, and Space Mountain all were great! Spend more time on those. (3) Be prepared for Richard Craniums who smoke vape throughout the park even though there are smoking areas and signs posted not to do so everywhere. Watching adults hide their cigs like they were 13 year olds in school is embarrassing. Btw: there are very few workers throughout the park itself. So, no one around to say anything to them.(4) If doing a day trip from Paris like we did, you   ll be getting up early and traveling at least an hour each way. Every day at a Disney day is exhausting, but this one was more so. My son and I only made it to about 18:00. My wife and two other kids were back to the hotel by 21:00. If I could do all over again, I might make this the last day of a trip, stay at a Disney hotel, and head directly to airport next day. In fairness, my kids had a lot of fun but all agreed without prompting that this park is nowhere close to what is in California or Orlando. As many people have said, there is less attention to quality and detail and seems more like a money grab. I will be back to Paris but this park.

There were no Disney characters around the park. I only saw Captain Hook who was walking from a to b. There was no interaction again with the visitors. The only thing there was plenty of in this park were shops. It felt like all Disney cared about was making as much money as possible out of its guests.

All rides still on old technology, none of the modern comfort facilities, the sad issues faced 20 years ago got worse.Here is a list of some of the issues we faced that spoiled the magic.1. Many rides breakdown repeatedly throughout the day and you have to leave after being in line for 40 minutes, and you have to keep monitoring the place till they fix it , examples, Big thunder mountains, Tower of Terror, space mountain, and even some of the live shows....2. Some of the rides are really old and should be removed, like Aremegodon, it is an absolute waste of time, 3. Most of th outdoor shows is a mess, no clear sitting areas, children don   t have a good view and they have absolutely no Magic in them!!,4. There are no heat beating facilities, like cold vapor or mist that you see in other parks, and even drinking water fountain are a few with long lines 5. Buying stuff is a nightmare, There are many scattered kiosks, but whoever priced the items should be fired... items like water, coke, ice cream are priced like 3.79, 2.27, 3.34...etc, and the poor attendant does everything manually with a tiny calculator, and while he serves the customer in 20 seconds, he spends th next 3 minutes in calculation the amount and counting carnage manually, assuming he has all th change. This cause queues as long as 30minutes to buy abs ice creams 6. To be able to watching the parades or fireworks properyl, you have to sit on the floor , 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of th events with the children and when it starts, you have people jumping over you and the arguments starts, with no organizer to be seen.

No positive surprises, unfortunately, but plenty of negative ones. Food and beverage prices are astronomical. Maybe not such a surprise that prices were high but the scale of the    daylight robbery    was. The worst surprise was the absolutely appalling customer service throughout the park, the worst of which we experienced at the American Diner. We were ignored upon arrival and seated some five minutes later. The choice was minimal, each of us taking a burger. The order took a very long time to arrive after at least a couple of reminders to staff. Other customers who ordered after us has almost finished their food before ours arrived. My son   s burger was raw in the middle. Our complaint was met with laughter and a patronising comment from a waitress. She said she   d have another prepared. We said we   d not wait another thirty minutes for another burger but were prepared to pay for the acceptable sandwiches, not the raw one. She declined, saying our order was already in the till and laughed. We had to wait at least a further ten minutes while she made a call to resolve the issue. In the end, we paid for the three burgers which were properly prepared and not the underdone one. All this, in an overheated space with flies buzzing around. I sought out a bag for a relative in one of the larger shops. I showed a woman at a till an image of the piece I   d like. She told me that if it wasn   t in the store, they didn   t have it.

We stayed in a Disney Hotel to get the extra magic time with 8h30 access to the park. We had four days, three nights at Disneyland and I will need a few days to recover from that experience. There were so many people. Everywhere. We kept track of waiting times for all rides with the app, but it really doesn't help much when the general minimum waiting time is at least 45min, even for the old, outdated rides. So that's all we did: we waited in line. Then you get your 90 to 120 seconds on a ride, and then you wait some more. Fast track is not available for most rides, and it's also closed during peak time (13h00 16h00). Quite a few rides are closed for refurbishment, and some others were just temporarily closed for technical issues. It happened twice that rides were closed after we had stood in line for at least 20 or 30 minutes, that was extra special. For lunch, we didn't even bother with real restaurants even though we had vouchers, we thought the fast food line would be faster. But even there you can expect 35 to 45 minutes just to place your order. It was really insane. The parades are very beautiful, but you better claim your spot on the pavement at least 30 minutes early if you have small kids, because there is not enough space for all visitors to see it. If it's burning hot like it was on our days, you better prepare to wait in the burning sun for a long, long time, defending your viewpoint. The parade is pretty much your only chance to see the disney characters, unless you feel like waiting in line for 60 minutes to take a picture with Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse or Goofy. For the princess, you queue for 120 minutes. What a great way to spend your holiday. Extra magic time is a bit of a joke. You can see there are a lot less people in the park, but most of the rides only open at 10h00 in any case, so the joke was on us, again. The park itself is designed in a really beautiful way. We couldn't really focus much on it as we were getting worried we would lose our kids in the crowds. I really thought they would have more playgrounds around, to take pressure of the rides, and maybe more rides for small kids, also to take pressure of the more popular rides. The railings were a clear sign that it's not even season yet. In season, visitors should prepare for a minimum of 70 minutes per queue, the more popular rides will take a good 2h. We spent a lot of money on this trip. I can see how Disneyland could be a lot of fun. I can't see how it is even legally allowed to let so many people in.

If I could swear here I would, we purchased 2 chicken wraps and a kids chicken nuggets, expecting as it's    42 that the food would be warm....Nope, the type of thing you buy in a petrol station half way through an 11 hour journey because you are starving, only 15 times the price,Day 3 will occur tomorrow and this is the most exciting day, simply because we get to go home, no one could possibly pay me enough money to take my family to this vile place again !",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

213,583750777,1,2018-5,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I visited visited Disneyland years ago, and I had fond memories of it. Perhaps we were lucky as we went during a quiet time (week before Easter) and we enjoyed the rides and other attractions. Fast forward 12 years, and my boyfriend and I are married with two kids, 9 and 7. We booked a trip to Paris, and I was keen on visiting Disneyland for two days (the husband wasn't so happy about it), so I booked online and bought tickets for two days, Friday 25 and Saturday 26 of May.We arrived at Disney only to be greeted by huge queues to get through security. Then more queues to scan our tickets. After 30 minutes, we finally made it into the park. The first ride I wanted to go in, the train that goes around the park, already had a waiting time of 60 minutes. Things went downhill from there. Huge queues at most of the rides, some rides were not working, fastpass was not working on some of the most popular rides. The children started complaining about lunch time, and asking when could we go back to the hotel. I had spent a lot on money on the tickets, so by golly we were staying for longer. They wore me down around 6ish, so we went to the shopping centre near the hotel and they had more fun on the little playground area than Disney. When I announced that we had tickets for the following day as well, they groaned. As it was a Saturday, it was even worse. Ridiculous queuing, fastpasses working only on half the attractions with fastpass, more shops and restaurants than attractions, and the hordes of people. Oh, the hordes. Buying overpriced ice creams (nearly 4 euros!!!!), drinks, meals and assorted tat. I gave up all hope at around 5ish, we went back to the hotel, had a nice meal at the restaurant nearby, and swore never to set foot on that hellhole again. My children would never forgive me, and they are the ones who are going to choose my care home when I'm old.The only highlight of our trip was the day spent in Paris. I wish I had known, we would have had three days to spend in beautiful Paris instead of on.So, a quick summary:*Too many people.

It wasn   t just one ride it was 3 in total. The other thing we were unhappy about was none of the characters were walking around in the grounds which meant you had to queue up for an hour to see an individual character   unlike Florida where they come out and greet everyone. The Mickey Mouse Show was very enjoyable as was The Tower of Terror. However whilst queuing for Thunder Mountain it developed a mechanical fault so another ride we did not get to experience.

217,581117608,2,2018-5,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I went to Disneyland Paris as a present for our twentieth birthdays, it was a present from my parents and they thought it would be nice me and my boyfriend go on holiday together for the first time.The last time I remember going to Disneyland was when I was around nine and all I could remember was that it was a magical place I wanted to go again. Between that time my family and I had been to Disney world in Florida twice, both had been amazing experiencing with excellent hotels, staff and food. I was very excited for this trip because it would truly be the first time abroad without my family but from the get go things seemed to go wrong, especially in the parks. The staff were overall rude. I speak little French, as does my boyfriend due to us obviously being English tourists. The first incident happened in a food court where we had just ordered some food and upon paying the staff what we had ordered, the person handling the money said something rather snarky in French. It appears he did not think we could understand him, either way we were not very impressed by his behaviour or the fact the French staff around him seemed to find his comment very amusing. The second incident happened later on in the trip when me and my boyfriend were deciding where we should eat, we decided on a buffet. We approached the front of one of the buffets to find no one there but when a staff member arrived they did not greet us or even smile, just stood there waiting for us to talk. I explained that we wanted to see the food that was on offer at the buffet. She explained only one of us could go and look, so I volenteered to go on. A few minutes before we had stopped at a food stand so i could grab an apple, i had been eating it while we stood waiting at the buffet and the staff member at the front desk of the buffet clearly saw i had one. Upon leaving the staff member wouldn't let me leave the premises and pointed to the apple, indicating that i had stolen it! 1. There were no apples available on this buffet. 2. If i stole it why would i openly eat it in front of everyone. 3. They had seen me take it in. Either way their behavior towards me was very rude and when i explained the situation that i had bought the apple in with me, they didn't seem all too impressed anyway.The third incident happened on the last day on our trip. We had bought fast track tickets for the mountain ride in Frontierland. We had been excited for this ride all day and we headed for the fast track queue where several other families and couples were waiting to have their tickets checked. Then out of the blue two young woman decide to push through the queue. Of course i stop them, no way was i having someone push in front of me, but even then they barged past me and other families with young children and certainly caused a scene while doing it. The staff member checking tickets did not do anything to sort out this situation. They simply looked at their tickets and let them through leaving me and of course several other people shocked that they hadn't said or done anything to these queue jumpers. Comparing this trip to Disneyland Paris and to my trip to Disneyworld, i can honestly say the people at Disney world are nicer and more welcoming while the ones at Paris acted like they did not even want to be there or help you. I think Disney needs to really consider who they employ and what training they are putting them through. I will not be visiting Disneyland Paris again, i would rather save my money for a trip where i do not feel like i am in a hostile environment.

Disneyland Park and Disney Studios Park on the other hand were terrible. Both where visibly overcrowded and most rides had a waiting time shown of 50 to 70 minutes. I wonder how it must be during peak season. This was supposedly off peak and the chaos was the same each of the 5 days we stayed there. Buying a  FASTPASS  didnt help much as it is not valid between 1 and 4 pm and making a booking gave you a time of 5.30pm or later. Haunted Mansion was closed for refurbishment, Space Mountain was closed due maintenance. The waiting time also was ridiculously long at the fastfood outlets and those few restaurants offering sit down table service you couldnt get a table unless you booked the previous day. All in all a waste of our time and money. We paid for the Disneylandhotel (5 nights at halfboard) with park passes included for 3 of us the stupid price of 4300euro. On a positive note, since we were firced to skip several breakfasts, lunches and dinners, voicing my frustration upon check out, the reception at the hotel offered us a partial refund in exchange for the meal vouchers we were not able to use due overcrowding in the available Disney restaurants. We visited Disney in other countries in previous years and this is about the worse experience we had ever. A very disppointed family who is not ready to repeat this disaster anytime soon.

226,574338451,2,2018-3,United Kingdom,"Went with our 2 kids for our daughter's birthday in March 2018. We found the queue times in both parks too long in general for low season. I had heard that    Disney do queues well     they entertain you whilst you wait, the queues are fast moving and kept to minimum times.    Unfortunately this was not our experience     we used the app on my phone and found many waiting times to be over 30 40 minutes & in some cases 70 minutes. The 1950s drive your own car ride was a 45 minute wait     which we did wait for; to find that only half the track cars were being used     why not open up the full ride to reduce the queuing time? We used magic time on both days to try to get on rides before the general public but found that fast pass booths were closed at this time meaning that we were unable to book ride times at all during this    magic    hour. We still had to queue 25 mins per ride minimum to get on a ride during this time. Not a huge benefit of staying at a Disney hotel to be honest. The fast pass system was barely a benefit. We would make our way into the park in the morning, fast pass a big ride that we all wanted to go on only to get a ride time hours later   10:30am we fast passed a ride and got a 6 7pm slot and couldn   t book another fast pass for a further few hours meaning we had to queue at every ride anyway. There were no Disney characters just walking about the streets saying hi to the public     there were only meet & greets at specific times and queues for those were well over 25 minutes. Princesses meet & greet was 70 minutes on all the 3 days we were there. We did not meet a single character. There were insufficient refreshment stalls small outlets open     we queued 30 minutes for 4 bottles of soft drinks at one point, along with other unhappy customers because there was only 1 outlet open in the Adventureland vicinity and only 1 member of staff on in there. I can say that at no time on any rides did I think anything felt unsafe  unchecked   not something I can say for other theme parks we have visited.We upgraded our booking to include full board    plus    meals and I duly booked slots in restaurants ahead of our stay as I   d heard they get busy. Ice cream   caf   outlets that were open had queues out of the door and to the other side of Main Street     minimum wait of 25 mins   not worth it. We found ourselves walking back to the Disney Village to get drinks ice creams and to have a sit down because those options were so lacking in both parks.No member of staff approached us in general to see how our stay was going, to offer to take a photo of us as a family, to tell us about something in the parks which was going on, or to offer us help. No member of staff    went out of their way    to make sure we had nothing less than a fantastic Disney magical time. It felt like we were part of the cattle being herded in to spend money and be herded out. Overall, we didn   t enjoy Disnleyland Paris nearly as much as we had hoped   we did have good times during the weekend, went on some great rides eventually, got some good family photos and enjoyed the slightly warmer weather but sadly we were hugely underwhelmed with Disneyland Paris and didn   t find the Disney magic.

227,574250619,2,2018-4,United Kingdom,"OK so we took our 11 and 8 years old to Disneyland Paris in the Easter Holidays. We drove and the as the first thing you see as you approach the park is a row of toll booths for the car park and that's a cost of 25 Euros per day so make sure you factor that into your budget. We went for two days which still wasn't quite long enough (although it should have been, more on that later). After the toll booths the car park isn't far at all and we easily found a space on both days. The next thing you have to do is get to the ticket desks, this is quite a walk and although there were airports style motorised walkways a lot of these were broken and not working. So we queued for some time and bought our tickets and then queued to get into the park. We decided to go to Disney Studios Park first as it was smaller and there were less rides we planned to go on there. (this is a handy tip so if you can plan the rides before you go it will save you some time on the day). We queued for a couple of rides which we ended up being turned away from as they had broken down! Which was a lot of wasted time. Our daughter also wanted to meet Moana so we bought her an autograph book but then found out there was an hour and a half queue to see her! This was sadly much the case for all of the meet and greet characters and we only got to see a couple as we happened to catch them 'setting up'. A lot of them also finished quite early on the day so go to them first thing of it's something you want to do. We went to see the car Stunt show which was also cancelled last minute so more time wasted. We did go back on the second day and it was very good. We spent most of the second day in the main Disney park. There's lots to do here but again be careful as although the park didn't close until 22:00 a few on the rides closed at 17:00 and 20:00 which we weren't aware of and so we missed a few things we wanted to do. Another tip is not to eat in the main area unless you want to pay   15 for a burger. On the second day we found out there's a McDonalds and other restaurants much better priced near the entrance of the parks. We had a 'fast pass' ticket which I would highly recommend as some of the regular queues were 90 minutes long or worse. However its all done manually and could do with an update. Overall I would say its worth a trip here for 2 or three days.

They have only one shuttle servicing all those hotels. It would get so crowded at the stop that people were pushing and shoving to get on when the shuttle actually came.Second the parks are small and unimpressive. If you love Disneyworld don't go here.

Except at the character lines. Not all rides have pictures either. I waisted 70 euros.Third the food is not that good. However we found one good restaurant. It's called Remy's restaurant. We also met a really nice woman working there named Mariam. She got us a reservation even though the restaurant was booked solid. We also met an artist in The art of Disney animation who was great to my daughter by the name of Sally.There were more issues but those were the big ones for me.

We have been visiting Disneyland Florida for the past 10 years and decided to try the Paris Disneyland for a change. We are extremely disappointed with our visit to Disneyland Paris, maybe because of visiting Florida so many times before   however, the amount of money for a ticket to Disneyland Paris we expected more attractions   rides and general things to do whilst we were there. The park doesn   t offer many attractions   rides so all of the wait times were 60 minutes or more. There were also no fast passes left for any of the main attraction rides that we were wanting to go on. This being said, we were only at the park around 3 hours which includes an hour sit down meal. Considering a 2 park ticket is almost 90 Euro   s per person, we expected to be wowed with Disney   s Paris attractions as Florida has never disappointed us. I would not recommend anyone to visit Disneyland Paris and would instead recommend you save your money and visit Disneyland Florida instead which is a fantastic family holiday and experience for all   great weather, great parks and great memories to be had.

There is a total lack of staff outside the gates to assist and advise many people joined queues to buy tickets only to find after long delays they could go up and enter straight away. If you have a ticket with security checks and entry to the park it   s probably 30 45 minutes. If you don   t have tickets probably 1.5 to 3 hours delay in getting in.

We visited DisneyLand Paris for New Year   s Eve Day and night with our two children, age 6 and 9. It was our first time at DisneyLand Paris and we were super excited. Such experiences are precious and we were well prepared for the day.We anticipated big queues for rides and autographs and accepted that we wouldn   t get to do everything that we wanted to during our visit     no problem, we   d enjoy what we did get to do.What we hadn   t anticipated was the complete and utter chaos that would be the transition between the day and evening. We had been online several times in the run up to new year to look for guidance regarding how the evening would run. There was very little information available.Our coach company were equally uninformed despite trying to obtain information.During the day we asked the staff where we needed to show our evening tickets     we were told we didn   t need to leave the park     only people who didn   t have a ticket needed to leave. Later on, we were by thunder mountain at the time, we found out from another staff member that we would need to exchange our evening tickets for a wrist band     it was starting to get dark at this point. We made our way round the long one way system shuffling through the crowds.We asked 5 different members of staff where we could get the wrist bands from we were told:     There are staff wearing red handing them out in front of the castle        that was not true, when we found a staff member (after navigating the long one way system, as so many people with lights were cutting off the straight routes) they said:     The entrance        on the way to the entrance we asked another staff member, they said     customer relations        we queued and were told after queuing:     The train station    (we then checked this again with another staff member)When we finally got to the train station (with two very hungry and tired kids) we then had to queue again to get the wrist bands and were then once again pushed back around a one way system (through the staff quarters where people were    off duty   ) and ended back up at Thunder Mountain. All the restaurants and cafes on the main street were then closed until 8 pm, so we couldn   t get the kids any food (again the staff were uninformed about what was open     we were told nowhere was, this wasn   t true either as we got food eventually in the adventure zone).At this point, we decided to draw a line under the debacle and enjoy the rest of the evening. After the AMAZING parade we headed over to see the swing band. We were at the front of the large queue and were all ready for the start. After standing there for some time (with a staff member present), we were told that we needed to enter from the other side     we went round, and were told it was now full   . (along with lots of other people who had been queuing with us)We decided if we bought a drink and some fries we   d watch from the tabled area     the staff were rude at policing this and after queuing (again) for fries and encountering a very tired and rude staff member on the tills were eventually got fries     there were no seats left and we were moved 3 times by staff. We had some amazing experiences at Disney     we had a taster of how good it could be, but so much of it was spoilt by the above that even though we tried not to let it tarnish the experience     we   ve heard our kids telling several of their friends of this as part of their experience     we didn   t want this to be their    takeaway    memory.We made Disney guardians of our kids magic.

The rides great but in the cold weather breaking down. Girls that had to be rescued from the Indiana Jones roller costa were given a ticket to go to the front of the queue as compensation. They had waited 30 minutes to be rescued, were freezing cold and unwilling to risk that ride again. So how a ticket onto the same ride was in any way compensation I failed to comprehend. A lot of the staff were 'grumpy', especially in the shops, food outlets and customer services.

The rides were imaginative and indoors as well as outdoors thankfully. Queue for rides times were not true to the times displayed; some earlier and some later.

How can you not with the rides, the characters and the parades? This review, however, is not aimed at the attractions, but at the rest, which are vital to making up a full, enjoyable day at a place like Disneyland. And one of the keys here is money! Many family groups will visit Disneyland and will face approaching 80    100    bill for the pleasure of enjoying a full lunch. That might not sound like much, but for us it meant it just wasn   t feasible to have a sit down lunch, with snacks we had brought in having to suffice. The same was the case for merchandise, which seemed so much more expensive than we would have anticipated. This is another area that Brexit has damaged in terms of exchange rates, but even so, everything seemed to have been uprated. Finally, coffee! We live in France and enjoy going to one of several places in our village to have a pleasant coffee. We have not had a bad cup of coffee for a long period, until Disneyland that is. Cafe au lait? Dreadful! The taste of coffee was distinctly absent   ever so slightly flavoured milk. Cafe noir? Yep, it was coffee, but only just. That was in the morning at least.

Prior to my visit, I researched the different web sites from different countries and was disappointed to find that the French web site gave the better deal by a long way. Why is there such discrepancy for the same product? It already felt like a rip off. I booked our trip in November for a visit in February. In January, I began to think about the pre paid meal plan and discovered that because we had our hotel booking through the French web site we had to book the meal plan through them as well. This meant that for exactly same product, we paid   28 more. Trying to phone the number on the booking was awful. Firstly, there was a 30 minute wait on hold, to be told that I needed to be transferred to someone who spoke English, was cut off, rang again, waited a further 45 minutes, found I was speaking to someone in America, who could not help me at all, had to start again. It took 4 calls before I finally was able to book, only to find that most restaurants were fully booked. Got a table at Silver Spur (was very tasty), but had to pay a further 28 Euros as our deal did not cover the cost, this despite asking the woman on the phone at the time of booking if we would have extra costs and being reassured that we would not. Had our children not been so looking forward to this trip, I would have cancelled at this point. I sent an email to the complaints line before we left, received a confirmation email explaining that they were very busy, but they would endeavour to get back to us within 15 working days. Still waiting...In the park, we had to queue 30 minutes for the extra magic hours. Why only have one entry point for all the people staying at the hotels? Absolute waste of time as most of the rides were shut until 10 am anyway.The queues for the rides were on average 45 minutes and we experienced many breakdowns whilst queuing which meant that the wait was a waste of time and the fast passes ran out before they were running again. On our last day, we managed 2 rides before 2 pm due to late starting rides, rides shut and rides breaking down. Took a chance with queuing to complain at City Hall and were given fast passes for 3 rides, which was something, but as we were leaving at 4pm that day, it was a rush to use them.We stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, booking a room for 4 of us to share. Our room was small, but enough for what we wanted. However, there was a double bed and a sofa, which it turned out we needed to put up ourselves. Really?! Breakfast was horrendous, families fighting for space amongst the huge school groups and filling up on purely carbs   bread rolls, croissants, cereals, bread   with a bit of cheese and yogurts. We were told that the fresh fruit order had not arrived yet. All in all, this has been a very expensive trip which has left us feeling ripped off and disappointed with the whole thing.

So as soon as we got home i booked to return 6 weeks later with my daughter who has wanted to do Jedi training since they cancelled it before she became 7.As you can imagine my daughter was very excited to be going back to experience the Jedi training, and took it very badly when we arrived in Discoveryland to find out it wasn't on. I went straight to City Hall to complain as that was the only reason we went back so soon, to be told  Yes it was planned but then we cancelled it, if you would have checked online you would have seen that it was cancelled  (which I can't find any mention of a cancelation anywhere) and that  There are other Starwars animations and shows , which didn't really make up for the money I spent to get there! Don't think I'm the sort of person who expects compensation or anything like that, but I was shocked at the fact that even though I had explained to the the member of staff in City Hall the fact I was on a holiday I didn't need to be on, and where I'd left my wife at home with a our youngest daughter, all they could say was,  Sorry about that .So just be wared that they can cancel planned events without informing you, all of this after raising the price of our Annual passes by    150 each!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
259,560596771,1,2018-1,United Kingdom,"I visited for a much needed break with my 8 and 7 year old in January for a weekend. We came from uk and stayed at the New York so my comments are based on just this   a Disneyland park package holiday. This included tickets, early entry, full board and hotel. It is also worth noting we have visited WDW before. I was extremely disappointed in every area. Firstly, pervasive were staff   they tried, but this left them acceptable   not the Disney difference and when things were not right, that customer service element was absent. That is so key to Disney, that attitude that you are here for something magic and we try to achieve that. The worst bit is they don   t even recognise it as a problem because it isn   t even part of the culture.The rides are mostly just that   there is nothing really unique here and what there is seems to have been pulled away   autopia not running, 3D show where captain eo was has gone, the fantastic pirate ship not open to public, playground closed. There is just no sparkle   lol those street performers, all the waving cast members on Main Street, all those ad hoc shows   none of that. It is just like another theme park. And seeing characters walking around clocked like some sort of creature rather than through hidden cast member access simply freaked my kids out. Poor show   Walt would not approve.The food is appalling   I made this comment 10 years ago on this site and prices have gone up and quality down. We ate two dinners and both cost over 100 euros and was inedible.The PhotoPass is beyond a rip off 60 euros for ride photos of low quality you don   t even want. As with many things you may judge this against the photopass you get in America were you will get dozens of photos taken per day   we didn   t get a single one outside a ride photo Conclusions   we enjoyed some rides. This was not worth the money, not special and destroyed buildings, characters and attractions that in America through these subtle staff and strategic elements become special.

Twice queued for over 30 mins for a ride only to be told there was a technical problem & to come back later. Very few staff around to assist with any queries, all the staff we saw were working on the actual rides.Very few actual Disney characters seen out & about around the parks.Disney Studios park is basically a non event.Getting into the parks the security checkpoints were farcical, too small, not enough of them, long queues, some bags checked some weren't, twice I walked in without putting the contents of my pockets in the tray, the red lights on the scanner were simply ignored.Food & drink outlets, Quality very average, prices very expensive.Retail outletsFar too many of them, all selling exactly the same merchandise at the same outrageously inflated pricesHotelStayed at the New York & really wished I hadn't wasted my money. Have reviewed this separately on Trip Advisor.Value for moneyMost definately not. This is blatant profiteering at its ugliest. We went as a couple, how families with children can afford this place is beyond me and as this whole concept is child orientated I think Disney Corp should be ashamed.Everything (with only 2 exceptions that we came across) from the overall package, the food, drinks, hotel, merchandise is at least 3 times the cost it should be.I'm afraid I only have positive comments for 2 things. 1st   The Wild West Show was very good, expensive at    65 &    80 but compared to everything else the price is approaching acceptable for the entertainment and the food & drink.2nd   Earl of Sandwich food outlet in Disney Village. Selection, variety & quality very good, price of    6.50 for std size sandwich (which is similar to a panini size) or around    11 for double. A few more outlets of this kind & at these types of prices would make a world of difference.Disneyland Paris is one of those places that are a must visit, so one can say Been there, seen it, done it.

I asked them to show me where on the Disneyland Paris website it states that the price at the gate was    79 which they were unable to do.I complained and asked to speak to a supervisor which they begrudgingly allowed me to do so after making me wait 30 mins. The supervisor stated that the    79 ticket price was not advertised anywhere and never would be. I then suggested to the supervisor that by failing to advertise the    79 price, Disneyland Paris was breaching the European Union's directive regarding misleading advertising practices. The supervisor's response was that I should sue Disneyland then.I asked the supervisor if he was happy for me to post the fact that he had suggested I sue Disneyland on TripAdvisor? After this he became very defensive and quiet and refused to speak to me anymore.Long story short, if you are going to Disneyland Paris make sure you buy your tickets online, at least one day in advance and preferably from a third party provider (we ended up coming back the next day and paid only    45 from a company online, even cheaper than Disneyland was offering).",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I researched that I would be able to fast track certain rides with my friends to avoid standing for long periods of time and that I should bring evidence to get this. I brought my hospital letters and after queuing for over an hour to be seen at a desk I provided them with this to be told I would have to book at rides and wait hours and go back at the booking time to get on. This system was ridiculous as it meant I had to kill sometimes 2 hours before going on anything and before long the day is over. I found the staff very rude and unfriendly, in the main restaurant by the castle I was made to queue without a seat for again another hour and the lady showed no sympathy towards myself while we waited. Then to watch the illuminations show there was no seating either so it ended up being a really long and unenjoyable day at Disney, the worst part of all was that at the end I was told they should have given me a wheelchair which would have made life much easier but obviously they failed to do this.

266,553525466,1,2017-11,United Kingdom,"Hour long Queues: For a majority of the rides there was an hour (sometimes even more) long queue.   For your customers that only stay in Disneyland for a day or two, this is quite a big issue as it means we have less time to fully enjoy Disneyland. FastPass: This is especially frustrating when it is virtually impossible to utilise the FastPass. You had to get to the ride you wanted first thing to book everything in advance rather than just queue in the FastPass lane like you would in any other theme park (why would you go to a ride, to then go away and come back?). Despite showing up very early all the rides were booked out too quickly by the time we got to them, so we didn't actually get to use this even once!Magic Hours and  Technical Difficulties : The above points pretty much ruined our first day in Disneyland, but we had hopes for the morning with the  magic hours  we were promised in our package deal. We were told that this gets 2 extra hours in the park before it becomes open to the public, however, our hotel receptionist informed us that this was in fact only 1hour 30 mins. Every minute counts in Disneyland and I've been waiting to get to Disneyland all my life, but we let it slide.... We head over to the rides that are supposed to be open at this time: Rock 'N' Roller and Ratatouille, but both are facing  technical difficulties  and didn't expect to be open until 10am   coincidentally the normal park opening time. At this point, we feel pretty upset, as we know that as soon as the park officially opens, there are going to be hour long queues all over again for rides that last a maximum of 7 minutes and an average of probably under 1 minute. But as we make our way around the park, at 9:30 we stumble across a reasonably long queue for Pirates of The Carribean, due to open in 30 minutes. We decide to queue whilst it's short and hope for a 40 minute queue tops (considering it doesn't open until 10am anyway). After 35 minutes of queueing   people from the queue in front of us begin randomly dispersing. We go to ask a staff member at the front what happened, and the answer? Technical difficulties YET.AGAIN. We rush over to the park train in hopes that we haven't missed our last chance of getting into a shorter queue before the crowds come out in full force, but of course, they already have. We suck it up, accept our fate, and wait... A train arrives. It's pretty packed but there are a few spaces here and there. They could probably take about a quarter of our queue. Wrong. The Disney staff haven't even opened the gate for us to line up at each carriage and before you know it, the train leaves. No one from our queue had boarded. Better luck on the next train. Another hour long queue in the freezing cold. Food: Table service restaurants:  but you don't have a reservation? Sorry, we don't have any tables left.  How can you fail to raise awareness of this? Had I been made aware of this at the time of booking I would have even made a deposit if I had known how difficult it was to simply get some food. There's no option of reserving online at all   you literally have to go to the restaurant itself to make a reservation   how would first time visitors know this? After being turned away by all of your table service restaurants, we tried to order just anything from a self service fast food restaurant, with queues as long as they were for the attractions and with nowhere to sit unless you sat outside... unheard of. Disney Characters: We only spotted 4 characters the entire time we were there   not including the parades   which doesn't really count as I couldn't see them, being right at the back of the crowd which began to form around an hour before the parade started, making it impossible to do anything, really... As with everything getting a photograph taken is also an hour long queue. Overall it really didn't feel like it was Disneyland at all. It felt more like a general theme park or even a pop up funfair during half  term with the only exception being the Disney illuminations. After complaining to Disneyland, they offered us free park tickets, which is an absolute joke as I wouldn't go back to relive the above if they paid me. When we refused the free park tickets, they didn't even refund us the price of 1 adult, 2 day 2 park ticket.

268,551482122,2,2017-12,United Kingdom,"My review for Disneyland would have been a 5 star review quite easily had it not been for our experience at the  New years eve party  The park itself is fantastic, spotlessly clean, well looked after and the rides are all fantastic. If you have little ones, bring them, they will love the place. My only gripe is that there really are no Disney characters wandering around for anybody to interact with, instead you must queue for a minimum of 1hr at a time to have a few pictures with one of them. If you want to meet Mickey or Minnie however change that time to 2hrs minimum. Pricing for food can also be horrendously expensive, if you shop around however there are a few cheaper places to eat. We came here to enjoy New Years, it turns out Disney advertise this as an exclusive event when it is anything but! I've never seen an event do ridiculously oversold than this. There were more people in the park for New Years than there ever was during a normal day. We purchased the tickets a long time in advance thinking they would sell out. Despite being advertised as sold out, tickets were still being sold on the day in the park. We arrived at the park on New years eve minus our party tickets, thinking we wouldn't need them until the evening as the park was still open as normal. As we got into the park we saw a sign in French asking people to get their wristbands for the NYE party. We asked an official how we got them to be told you need your party tickets, the same tickets that advertised  THIS IS YOUR TICKET, PRESENT AT PARK GATE FOR ADMISSION  any sane person reading this would assume that this was all you need, but no we were wrong apparently. So after frantically re downloading the tickets to my phone and then queuing for another two hours to exchange the tickets for wristbands we got on with our day. I will add that 2 hours in Disneyland is a lot, those two hours meant we couldn't go on some of the bigger rides because the queues get too big. So we weren't best pleased. Upon our arrival in the evening it was quite quickly apparent that the event had been massively oversold, probably owing to Disney's relentless abilities to bleed people dry of money whilst at the parks. When we reached the front of the queue we saw that there were attendants just giving out wristbands for anybody who hadn't got one during the day.. the same wristbands that we were assured had to be obtained during the day or you would not be able to attend the  party  however it got worse.. as we went to our gate to enter we showed the attendant our wristbands only to be told.. no no not those we don't really need those but I do need your tickets please. Absolute joke. The park is an absolute disgrace when it comes to organisation. It turned out the wristbands were purely to show to staff when they asked to prove you had a ticket... the same ticket that had to be used to gain entry in the first place!!!!! Finally in.. we thought great, lets get food... not possible.. everywhere was either booked or you faced a 3 hour queue. Want a coffee? Excellent go an get one... but queue for an hour first... popcorn? Yes please, queue for an hour.. everywhere was oversubscribed and nowhere could cope with the sheer volume of people. Disney's parades are incredible, I'm quite happy I saw a normal parade so we were both excited to see the NYE parade which brought together all the best bits from throughout the year. Well it was fantastic, excellent, extravagant and brilliant, everything that we had hoped for.. except we had to stand around for 3hrs to make sure we had a place to see the parade.. standing for 3 hours whilst not being able to move for a coffee or food is quite a feat, but the sheer cheek and rudeness of some people make it damn near impossible! Added to this the parade was also 30 minutes late with no explanation. Once the parade had ended we thought great a couple of hours to get some rides in and maybe finally eat.. we were wrong. Restaurants booked up until midnight and most places having at least a 2 hour wait... still could be worse, we could have had to queue and stand about to get a decent place to watch the fireworks for the next 2hrs... oh wait... we did have to!! People claimed spaces to watch the fireworks 2 hours in advance meaning everybody then had to do the same.. the fireworks were awesome! Well worth the wait and certainly better than any I've seen anywhere else. After the fireworks we decided to call it a night, we made it back to the bus park for 1am.. we weren't back at the hotel until 3:30am. The sheer volume of people made it impossible to get on a bus. I felt sorry for the police that had been drafted in to keep the place secure.. they stood no chance.

We spent 13 hours here from 10am 11pm... since it was a one day visit, so we were expecting to have all of our meals here, and to try some different food. Despite the fact that many of the rides had a wait of around 2 hours and some of the staff were pretty rude, the rides were great fun and the parade was fabulous (from what we could see, you have to park yourself into a space 45 minutes before the parade starts so that you can actually see it. There is few, if any, high vantage points). So, with the majority of guests spending the entire day within the park, DLP have a captured market of tens of thousands of people per day; naturally you would expect there to be a varied choice of establishments to dine. Nope. Nearly every quick service area in DLP serves the same food, despite the various interesting names and appearance of the caf  s; horrendously presented, frozen garbage clearly from an industrial sized box wrapped individually in plastic. And they charge you extortionate prices for the pleasure. Even though the caf  s are in different themed sections of the park, the menus remain largely the same. In Florida, each section has its own theme going on, and it continues with the food. DLP seriously lacks in diversity when it comes to food options.Onto the restaurants, don't expect to be able to take a spontaneous trip to DLP and be able to book a dinner reservation after 1pm. You will be sorely disappointed. Many of the restaurants are closed after 7:30 (WHY?! The park closes at 11pm!) meaning that the ones open after this time are absolutely swamped. This must create an illusion of exclusivity for DLP that they enjoy... the restaurants appear constantly busy and so people believe they are worth visiting. From what I hear, it's a very expensive variation of what you receive in the quick service caf  s.

I have too many examples of poor organisation, rudeness and cynical exploitation on the part of Disney Corporation to shake as many Euros out of us as possible. As the main beneficiaries are children and Disney inspired childhoods, visitors seem happy to keep opening wallets and purses for over priced food, drink, activities (were there is a service.... there is a price tag). What struck me most were the queues (to be expected) but also the lack of joy as families milled throughout the park. The exception was the immediate adrenalin after (finally) finishing a ride but the 1 2 minutes of each ride was tarnished by the minimum 30 minute queue, whilst Disney Corporation allows in as many visitors as it can to keep the tills ringing. This exploitative model will become less popular and the magic, I am sure, will tarnish for other visitors unless Disney Corporation recognises that, like other businesses, it needs to change for the better.Such a huge disappointment and, whilst a 1 star rating seems miserly on my part   especially as the family made the most of being together (which is the point, of course)   I can't bring myself to offering more!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The toilets in most locations were horrible, with items not restocked.However my biggest issue was the number of people smoking, in queues, outside shops and milling around.

Waited in line at restrooms for over twenty minutes in the area by the Peter Pan ride. Food lines were insane probably 45 minutes. We had park hopper passes, so we went over to the studios side late in the afternoon to hopefully find some food lines that weren't so long. We were unsuccessful and they were shutting down some of the restaurants for the day. We eventually found an indoor restaurant near the Buzz Light Year ride that had shorter lines. I think I rode 4 rides all day long. Wait times were way too long and we were only able to get a few of the reserved time passes. We did go to a few shows including the finale, which is the best thing in the park. My experience in the 2014 was totally different. We rode almost every ride in the park and had no problem finding food or using the restrooms quickly. It seems they didn't have enough staff the second time around. I will not return.

Every single one of them were polite and informative. HOWEVER, we witnessed several of them just standing right next to some guests smoking and they didn't say a thing. Its almost as if they have tried in the past and had no success so they just decided it wasn't worth the effort.The rides were what you would expect. Sadly Space Mountain and Pirates were both down and Star Tours featured creepy none moving androids in the line up, but as for everything else it was the usual A  from us.Surprised that the park doesn't have Splash Mountain however. We were told it was because of the weather and I guess that makes sense. You don't wanna be walking around wet when its reaching 5 degrees.There were nice little touches here and there exclusive to this park like below the castle and the Princess dance at the side of the castle.All in all however the park left us wanting so much more and we left with more negatives than positives. :(We shall stick with Magic Kingdom in Florida and Disneyland in California for now.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Indeed when dropped at the park, your instructed to arrive back 15min early to avoid missing the bus home.The bus there was late, the bus home was late.

Buy your full price ticket online first about    392. Take that ticket to the disabled ticket stall on left hand side with yr disabled railcard or PIP letter etc amd THEN you will get a free carer pass.DO NOT follow the rubbish guidance on disney site as yesterday we got stung for    72 euro entry for 1 plus a free carer as we bought at the gate.NOW   take your tickets to CITY HALL and ask for a special disabled.pass. This allows you fast access to all.the rides via the exit, with hardly any standing or waiting. This is a family ticket so you can all get quick entry. This is a SPECIAL pass NOT a fast pass which u have to pay for. The SPECIAL pass is free.Note: the carpark is    20. Yes I said it correctly. Head to Disneyland Hotel. Show your disability parking permit when u purchase your car.park ticket, they will give u a ticket with a code on for disability parking which is a stones throw from the park.Extra note: if it is raining the disney.characters dont come out and light parades cancelled and rides shut. They don't care at all and it does not feel very disney at all. Don't go in the rain.Cheeseburger was    22!! Yep. But found pizza place that does a Royale Pizza, side salad big coke and fruit salad.

325,523512396,2,2017-2,United Kingdom,"My partner and I had been thinking about spending seven days visiting your parks with our four children over Christmas and new year 2017 2018 . Due to one of our children having a diagnosis of ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) we made an initial visit without the children to make sure it would be suitable for our family of six First impressions approaching the park could only be explained as a child's dream, magical! The staff were very polite, answering any questions we had about the park and worked efficiently at getting everybody into the park as quickly as possible. Again once through the turnstiles the place looked beautiful and very well maintained.It is with great regret to say the magic ended there. We found the park to lack organisation. Each ride we attempted to go on there was a wait of anything from forty ninety minutes. On atleast 3 occasions we were waiting for atleast forty five minutes to get very near the front to be told the ride is closed due to a technical fault. On one occasion we was waiting for 80 minutes! We expected to be offered a fast pass to return later in the day but unfortunately these were not offered. On one occasion when we approached a member of staff to gain a reason to our refusal from yet another ride they lacked the most simple of communication skills and came across unwilling to help with any of our queries this particular member of staff clearly lacked the professionalism we received from the gate staff. Due to our eldest having a diagnosis of ASD and ADHD the waiting times for the rides would be extremely difficult for any child but a child with autism to stand in the queues baring in mind everything is amplified to those with autism the sounds, the smells, the crowds, unwanted bodily contact these ,are just a few to name many anxieties and difficulties my son will face while at your park not to mention if he was refused entry to a ride after waiting such a long time this would result in panic attacks, meltdowns, which of course would ruin our family's experience at Disneyland.After the ordeal of queues we decided to try the 4D cinema experience, the wait to enter wasn't excessive and I must say it was brilliant and the children would have loved it. Unfortunately the negatives on the park far outweigh the positives on this experience. We chose not to wait in any of the character meet and greet queues due to the excessive queue numbers for a one minute experience similar to those of the rides. However if we were with the children they would expect to meet the characters but again we have to our child child's needs into consideration and determine whether he could handle waiting that long for photo, of course he couldn't the waiting times are as long as the rides. To meet the characters is part of the Disney magic and not to have would be extremely disappointing to all children. The only time we saw characters was when they were at, or on their way to the meet and greet point which is not at all like the magical adverts you see where all the characters are walking around the park.Due to been on a tight time scale we didn't have time to dine at any of the resteraunt on the park so we tried one of the fast food establishments you have dotted around the park. The food was basic, no better or worse then your standard fast food except the ridiculous price tag that comes with it, extremely over priced. I wouldn't mind paying the extra as prices are always higher once inside amusement parks etc although better quality of food would be appreciated for such an increase in price! Once we had eaten we seen that people had started gathering around the parade area (more then one hour before starting) so we decided to get a front seat to end the day on a positive. The parade and fireworks were spectacular! Probably the most positive part of the whole experience. It was well worth the wait to ensure a good view however if we had been with the children and with additional needs of ASD the wait to gain a good view would be difficult for an autistic child to do ultimately resulting in yet another negative experience.Christmas at Disneyland is and has always been a dream of ours to experience as a family but I feel a dream is all it could be. Is it worth the   1400 on park tickets for the seven days we had planned to risk the children's disappointment that we experienced when at Disneyland that in essence could spoil their whole Christmas.

Entering is chaotic and security personnel are just straight out rude and lack basic manners. When you are filled with excitement and joy visiting Disney, this is not what you'd expect to be greeted with. Lack of variety in merchandise within the stores, where the majority of goods are aimed at young children. Not much option or choice for adults. Despite visiting the park upon opening, the restrooms were on the poor side in terms of hygiene. The park is definitely bigger than Disney Hong Kong and offers more variety in rides. With that however, comes longer lines and wait times which is to be expected. For a quick meal you have a small range to choose from and are pre prepared so expect your food to be on the colder side. Hotter and  fresher  foods are available but after looking at reviews they either tend to be located within the Disney hotel or not worth the hefty price.

We stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel, thus allowing us to take advantage of 'magic hours' from 8am   10am. During this period, only Disneyland hotel guests may use the park. In one day, we enjoyed 6 rides (4 during magic hours and 2 with a fast pass). The Peter Pan ride was charming and imaginative   traditional Disney. So too was Small World. Buzz Lightyear was fun and I highly recommend the Mickey and the Magician show in the Walt Disney Studios   it was a lavish West End standard show which the whole family would love.This was the 25th anniversary year but large sections were closed off and there were long queues everywhere. Our express breakfast vouchers (offering a croissant, pain au chocolat, omelette burger, orange juice or hot drink) stated they were valid in 3 restaurants, but we were informed that only one restaurant (next to the Buzz Lightyear ride) was opened. We had to walk 10 minutes to the other side of the park. 6 tills were opened, all doing fast food and the same range of drinks, but we were restricted to the last 3 tills. It took half an hour to get our breakfast. The omelette burger (with egg and bacon) was ok but there were no veggie options till after 11am. Food options all over the resort are greasy and toxic. Fortunately the Star Wars themed seating area was spacious and imaginatively laid out like a lunar landscape   this cheered me up a bit.Several rides were functional, charmless and unimaginative e.g. Teacups and carousel. The atmosphere that I'd found on visits to US theme parks was lacking. I got the sense that the Disney charm found in US theme parks was being downplayed to cater to more 'sophisticated' French tastes. It gave the park a drab atmosphere   functional and mundane.During these summer holidays my family have visited Drayton Manor (inc Thomas Land and amazing zoo) theme park and CBeebies land at Alton Towers. We stayed at the child friendly resort hotels in both cases and had a wonderful experience at both. Both places had manageable queues for small children, an excellent variety of food, plenty of staff to help you and short distances between rides.I'd strongly recommend visiting the UK resorts.

Bossy parking attendant chased after us and shouted at us when we tried to park at the end of the row instead of the middle, where he then ordered us to park. Long walk from the car park with several of the travelators not working. Surly security guard closed the bag check for no reason just as we reached the front (having queued for 15 minutes)   caused chaos as the whole queue then had to merge with the adjacent queue. Smokers everywhere ignoring the no smoking signs and no one making them stop. The breakfast vouchers we were given were only valid in one restaurant (the other one was closed even though it was peak season). They closed a third of the tills just as we arrived, no doubt just to make sure that everyone could queue that bit longer. Badly organised service meant a 30 minute wait for an 'omelette burger' and a stale croissant. Massive queues for everything, even the smaller children's rides. Several of the 'big' rides broken down for long periods of time with no explanation. A 70 minute wait in hot sunshine for one ride.

We hid our massive disappointment from the children, but even they asked why it took so long so that they'd only been on 3 rides during the whole day.

There was no explanation of what this was so we assumed it was a ride. No staff there or signs to tell us any different. 90 minutes later we got into the building only to be told unhelpfully to come back at 5.00 and then my son MUST agree to go on stage or he couldn't go in (at which point he was terrified of fighting Darth and fed up). We were livid: we'd spent the entire morning in queues and not even been on a ride (or seen anything Star Wars related). The day got worse when someone had let their child poo, yes poo, on a bench which my son then sat on. We cleaned it up after a 20m queue for the toilet. On the plus side, they were clean. Luckily we bought sandwiches so no queue for lunch . We managed 3 rides in the afternoon. We used the Fastpass so only queued for 20m on the Buzz and Star Wars Simulator rides.

The Star Wars parade and the evening parade were enjoyed by the kids (although we could only see the top of the floats due to crowds). If you're only there for one day at a busy time, don't bother with both parks as you won't have time. We wasted money on that. Would've liked to see more characters wandering around and maybe entertaining people in the queues. Disneyland is basically a glorified theme park which is overpriced and too many are allowed in. They need to limit tickets for people to enjoy it. Save your money and go to Thorpe Park or Legoland instead unless you are a die hard Disney fan or love queuing.

Waiting times are much better than Orlando's; on average we waited for 20 minutes, except for a couple of atttractions where our max waiting time was 75 minutes. My only big complaint is that we rented a stroller at Disneyland Paris and it was stolen at our first attraction. For the hefty 20 dollar tag on the rental stroller I would expect a more sophisticated system to identify strollers. At the rental facility they give you a piece of paper where you write down the toddler's name and rhen you place it in a plastich pouch. We later found out that this piece of paper can easily be taken out of the pouch and then it's impossible to find your stroller back. Disneyland Paris, you can do better than that!!!

We went for the Star Wars: Season of the Force celebration, having booked two days, and were initially excited. When we arrived, that quickly vanished. Where to begin? The queues to actually get TO the entrance were unreal. No order, just a huge bottleneck of people funnelling through a couple of metal detectors. When we finally got through there, we discovered another queue, this time to actually get into the park. A WHILE later, we made it inside, and decided to have a bite to eat. Sadly, there wasn't really anywhere to sit and do that that wasn't already swamped with people, so we had to order counter service and basically sit on the floor. With that out of the way, it was on to the rides! Well, it would have been if there had been any with a less than 2 hour wait time. I gave DLP one star because the Aerosmith coaster and Tower of Terror were actually very good, when you actually got through the massive queues. As a huge Star Wars fan, I was looking forward to the show, however. That, and the sci fi themed area of the park. This part, however, was basically closed. Just let that sink in for a moment   They were putting on a STAR WARS celebration, and their Star Wars rides were closed. We nearly missed the show on the first day, because we asked about it at one of the information kiosks, only to be shrugged at vaguely because neither of us spoke French, and they apparently didn't speak any English. I should stress that the show itself was great, and salvaged the weekend for us. Sadly, I did not get a photograph with the  squad of stormtroopers  that we were promised would be patrolling throughout the day (2 guys showed up every hour or so, and were immediately swamped by people), and over the course of the weekend, we managed to get onto maybe 7 rides. And now you see why I am so excited to be going back to Universal, where they do everything so very much better. We'll stick to that in future, and won't be repeating our trip back to this badly run park.

Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and Thunder Mountain all with  technical issues . Huge waiting times which often resulted in the ride being closed before one got a chance to go on it. Sheep like crowds prepared to accept the worst possible experience. To cap it all off many of the staff that work here don't seem to get the Disney brand they are supposed to be ambassadors for. Totally clueless and unhelpful. Seem to take pleasure in informing you of difficulties. No investment for last ten years, peeling paint, old rides and total lack of magic in the park. Can't understand how Disney can let 14 million people endure this every year. I would write to the Chief Executive if there was any point to save people this. He won't read it as he is too smart to visit the park with his family. The only saving grace is that in 5 years time the place won't exist as it will go out of business.

However yet again at a Disney park we found our sons disability not taken very seriously. We had an issue with our entry tickets not working so instead of issuing new ones the chap at the turnstile tutted and struggled to comprehend that we were guests staying till Monday and that the tickets are in date. We then told him our son cannot be standing around this long and he then sent us to a booth to resolve. So we walked there and after 45 minutes of staff nodding their heads at us and looking confused . They finally realised the tickets needed replacing. Now my son had been standing and leaning for support on a railing for over 75 minutes. The que actually jeered at us for causing a long que and we were called names which I shan't repeat.Once they were finished issuing us tickets the staff member rudely told us  do not come back again as I won't help again, and that my tickets will only scan once?  Which is ridiculous as we visit our hotel through the day for breaks and rest time for my son. But now I am told the tickets issued won't allow re entry once leaving the gates. We entered the park at 11:30 and my son was in tears by 11:50 so we returned to the hotel.The whole ordeal was reported to the concierge a number of times and eventually at 17:05 brand new tickets were issued. But by that point we had enough of the embarrassment and my son wasn't able to continue using the park. We got up and left the following day without using the park.People need to understand when a person with disabilities is still or standing too long big problems and pain manifest. The staff knew he had trouble as they issued us a priority pass due to his difficulties so to keep us standing around for 75 minutes and asking us to be running around the parks to sort the tickets out was ridiculous.

The parking is expensive and very far away from the entrance. The parking attendants make sure they direct you to the furthest part too! We arrived at 9am in the parking and got into the park only just before 10am. We then had to wait for priority guests till after 10am. By then the crush was so huge that my 6 year old daughter got banged and crushed several times. We kept getting seperated as a family by people pushing in and pushing us out of the way. My 6year old got banged so many times during the day she left with several bruises on her head one from a turnstyle that hit her as she went through it and the rest of the time from other guests!We struggled to find a toilet for her that didn't have less than a 10minute wait. There are no family toilets. she was so desperate at one stage that my husband had to take her into the men's toilet. There was another dad in the men's toilet with his daughter in the same predicament.Resting and seating areas were very clogged up so we struggled to find anywhere to sit down as a family for a water break. All the seating is for the overpriced restaurants designed to make you spend more money on the disney machine.Some of the staff were extremely rude. One of the staff members actually caused me to fall over by openening a gate I was leaning on to tie me shoe lace. He couldn't even wait for 10seconds for me just to finish. He just opened the gate causing me to fall down, no apologies but just a very bad attitude!The indication for waiting times for rides are wildly optimistic! Autopia said the wait was 45mins on their board but my daughter was kept waiting almost 75mins no chance of leaving if she needed to go to the toilet urgently.The fast passes are not really that helpful once you get one you cannot get another one until you have done the previous one. Usually they are several hours away. After 6 7pm you cannot even get one and again only priority guests are allowed in on fast pass! It's not even worth buying the super fast pass as there are only 7 rides you can you use in disneyland park.I gave disneyland park a star because some of the rides are good, and my teenage son enjoyed them but in the evening we got stuck on rides in the middle of several rides. There was a distraught child crying on one of the rides that got stuck.When we left with a our very exhausted children we were purposefully directed through the disney village with al their shops and restaurants which are designed to make you spend more money with disney. We got completely lost trying to find the parking lot and ended up having to go almost back to the park. No staff there to help you find your way out, no sign posts. Only a rude man on one of the other entrances who was explaining in French so we couldn't understand him to other lost guests that we had to go all the way back through the disney village to find the parking again! My daughter's last words were whilst in tears was 'I hate this place!' Is this the impression disneyland wanted to leave her with?If you are willing to spend the money there are ways the disney machine gives you priority but it's not about giving everyone a magical experience. For that you have to be willing pay quite alot of money!I did give it a star as some of the rides are very good, but you spend most of the times in a queue and very little time on the rides. So in truth Disney didn't make my daughter or my family's dreams come true. She had brief bursts of excitement amid long periods of boredom frustration and claustrophobia.

368,501306487,1,2017-6,Belgium,"I've been in Parc Disneyland on June 30th, with my family and a family of a friend of mine (4 adults   3 children).We are talking about one of the most beautiful parc in Europe, in terms of organisation, attractions, etc, but I think Disney Co needs to review seriously the way of managing the queues! The Parc is a long and endless queue: as it can happen children could be tired after one hour of queue (for 5 minutes of funny at the end), I wonder why is not possible to change the experience of waiting with the introduction of some screens showing Disney films. Perhaps the same film of the attraction you are waiting for: it is difficult to do so?Again: while waiting for Peter Pan, after 45 minutes of queue, the access was stopped for a technical problem. We were informed about this issue but decided to stay in the queue: after 50 minutes more (with no further info about the expected time for the technical solution) we enjoyed the experience. The question is: it is not possible in this cases to provide people in the queue with a special ticket to skip the queue for the same or other attractions? It would be a kind of compensation for the wasted time! After Peter Pan we did the queue for Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain but the attraction was broken while we were close to jump in the train (after 40 minutes): ok, we were not lucky that day, but a compensation like a special pass for other attractions would be very appreciated.Another remark: the expected time for jumping in the Disneyland Railroad is not true. In fact the train could arrive full in every station and the people in the train could stay on. So it is true that on average the train is in each station every 30 minutes: but you could wait for the next passage (or more) to hop on it.That's it: please do something for the queues or technical failures or the experience in the Parc won't be different from a normal day of traffic in a big city!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

However those rides have hideous wait times, the parade and light show need military planning in advance to actually see from a good spot and the food is crazily expensive. You come to expect these things from a theme park but the worst thing here is the staff who seem unable to answer a simple question without tutting and sarcastic replies.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the lengthly queues you were expected to stand in with small children. Some queues were up to two hours, to me this was just another money maker for disneyland as a professional photographer took the photo. When I had been previously in 2008 the princesses and the characters walked freely around the parks and there was lots of opportunities for them to stop and talk to children and get photo. I visited park at 10am one day and by 2.30pm had waited to see 3 characters princess's, It was unnecessary and could of been avoided if more princesses where available to walk around park Without having to stand in queues . The security wasn't any better, your lucky the security asked me to open my bag twice over the four days. I witnessed a security man shout at a lady who had a knife down her top, he told her if she done it again he would phone police. To me this was very distressing and police should have been told, police with gun's and dogs were within a shout of the security man in question. This made me feel very uncomfortable.

373,500354950,1,2017-7,United Kingdom,"There were a lot of things I didn't like about this park and that is why I have given it such a low score. Let me begin by saying that the rides I went on were great and the character meet and greets were great but the negatives outweighed the positives hence the low review.Cons:People smoking everywhere. This is my biggest complaint. There are designated smoking areas and this is supposed to be a  family friendly  venue but there were people openly smoking all over the park and I don't want to be walking around having smoke blown in my face or worse in my kids faces. Maybe its a European thing but I've never encountered it in all my visits to Walt Disney World in Florida.There are not enough of the rides and character meets that have fast passes. The queue for crush's coaster never got below 70 minutes and the queue for the princess meet and greet never got below an hour, and after queueing for an hour it would have been good to see more than 1 princess. In Epcot in Florida when you queue for an hour you get to see 4 characters. The rides are always breaking down. I think Thunder mountain must have broken down about a dozen times in the length of time that we were there.There aren't enough big thrill rides and that is why the queues are so long at the few that they have.Pros:The Park looks wonderful and walking around soaking in the Disney atmosphere is great.The hotels are so close to the parks it is great and makes a change from a 30 40 minute bus ride from your hotel to the Parks in Florida.Hopefully now that the US Disney has taken over the Paris one they will implement some necessary changes.

374,499865217,2,2017-6,United Kingdom,"Disneyland World   a place that is world renowned for delivering plenty of Disney fun. So how does its European equivalent in the land of liberty, equality and fraternity compare to the original in the land of opportunity? A recent visit enabled an interesting comparison, and the score card is not promising:1. Disneyland park and rides: how did my favourite rides match up to their counterparts in the U.S.? Not easy to ascertain... pirates of the Caribbean   closed for repair; A small world : closed for refurbishment ; space mountain (or rather their exciting new ride Hyperspace Mountain)   sounded promising given the screaming going on while we were waiting in the queue, however the ride broke down for the 2nd time that day 20 mins into our wait   so we were told to come back later.... At least the Haunted Manor did not disappoint (and was open, which was a bonus). 3 out of 4 of our favourite rides open   strike 1.2. Fastpass    Board within a matter of minutes  is how this service is described on the eurodisney website. The waiting time for our ride was 50 mins, so we showed up with our fastpass tickets at the allotted time and were in the queue for 40 mins... define  fast . Strike 2.3. Food and drink in the park   many reviews are already out there complaining about the   6 drinks and   10 sandwiches, so we won't repeat the overstated; let us instead focus on where you can consume these overpriced items. We were lucky enough to visit Eurodisney in brilliant weather and noticed several nice spots where we could sit down with our drinks and which were surprisingly empty   mystery solved: we tried to bring food and drink to the outdoor tables only to be told that food and drink were only sold to be consumed in the dark rooms that were the indoor dining spaces. Perfect on a cold winters day   not so good when wanting to take advantage of the sunshine. Strike 3.4. Disney hotels. My husband was there for a conference so my daughter and I tagged along for 2 nights. The New York hotel was our appointed hotel and as such a special check in lane has been designated for the members of this conference   but just the one lane out of 6 in the check in area. With more conference participants lining up to check in at the time we arrived than there were regular guests, the check in process was long and arduous as just one person was there to check everyone in and hand them their welcome packs. Some welcome. Strike 4.5. The room: more specifically cleaning thereof. I could say that I cannot comment as during our 2 night stay we saw no evidence of cleaning and did not see the maid once. No wait   we did see the trolleys in various parts of the corridors, however our room did not get made up. Granted, on the first day we did not leave the room until after 10am   this had never been a problem in other hotels so the next day we tried a different approach   leaving the hotel room earlier. Sadly this was no more effective and we returned yet again to a room of unmade beds and damp towels. The problem might be the  do not disturb  sign which is left on the door as we spent half an hour in the room after breakfast getting ready to visit the sights. On the third day with the conference being in full swing, my husband was out of the room by 8am. He returned to the room at noon for a shower and change of clothes (by which time the room still had not been done) and at that time put on the do not disturb sign... the maid fairies had obviously been lying in wait, as they chose that precise hour, noon to 1pm, to pounce and attempt to clean the room. They changed back into pumpkins at precisely 1.01 pm, so unfortunately he managed to notch up yet another day of no bedding or towel change. A call to reception revealed that there is no set time for the maid to pass, but once she has done your area that is it   she will not return that same day. No clean towels nor made up beds for 3 nights. Strike 5.6. The bathroom: the New York hotel is themed, as the name indicates, after the big apple. Pictures of skyscrapers adorn the rooms and halls, and in the bathroom a rather worn looking shower curtain is emblazoned with the NY Mets logo. Now while I do enjoy a good baseball game, if I want to see their emblem on my skin a tattoo might be an option   rather than the feeling of a cold wet shower curtain sticking to you (as well as every other previous users) while you shower. Haven't shower curtains been replaced with glass partitions in most good hotels? Strike 6.7. On the subject of bathrooms, I was eager to try out the ubiquitous array of free toiletries which are usually on offer in good hotels. But wait   there were none. Just a Mickey Mouse themed bottle of body lotion. Why only body lotion I wonder... does the stay leave you with dry body skin as well as frayed nerves... or does the shower curtain annoy patrons so much that they do not stay long enough to wash their hair? To make matters worse, on the before last day (when the room was finally visited by the cleaner) our handy travel size Bulgary soap (brought along especially for when hotel room soaps run out and are not replaced...) vanished from the bathroom. God giveth   and God taketh away... Strike 7.8. The hotel bars: we tried 2 different hotels in the resort and in both places you need to make sure that you have plenty of time set aside to enjoy the experience and that you polish off your dance moves as  wave your hands in the air like you don't care  is the only way you will get served. Still unsure as to what topic of conversation behind the bar kept the bar staff so enthralled, but at least we got an upper body workout.. strike 8.9. Minibar   do not make the mistake we did by removing anything from the fridge   they are automatically charged to your room within seconds of being removed from their sensor pads. Like Indiana Jones in the famous scene from raiders of the lost ark, we removed a drink from the fridge to take a closer look at what kind of water was being charged at   4 a bottle, but unlike Indy we did not had a bag of sand of equal weight to quickly replace on the sensor pad, and a call to reception confirmed that we had been charged for the item(s) removed. With no free bottles of water laid on for guests in the room like so many hotels do, Indiana Jones' worn water gourd looked better and better... Strike 9.It is however not all doom and gloom   unlike the maid service, the minibar checkers come to the room daily, without fail, to tally up and replace as need be any overpriced beverages that have been consumed. A call to reception to request clean towels is swiftly followed though with a member of staff bringing these to the room within 10 minutes. They did not enquire as to why we needed these so I assume that the lack of maid service means that requests for clean towels occurs on a regular basis. And finally, when the hotel restaurant is unavailable to guests as it has been booked out for various functions, they are quick to recommend and book other restaurants in the resort   with main courses starting at no less than   25....The only people having fun at Disneyland Paris these days are the ones sitting behind the tills....

The food is insanely overpriced  8 Euros for a hot dog, 25 Euros for a burger..coke 3.5 euros but there is zero competition so they can charge what they want.

It really is more a mall than anything else. My kids did enjoy many of the rides and the lightshow and fireworks and music at 11pm was quite amazing and everyone enjoyed that. We spent one long day here and that was lots for us..two days would have been too much and too expensive. After spending 11 hours there we saw three characters total.. a pincochio and two squirrels of some kind...broke my kids hearts to not see any of the big characteris like MIckey or Minnie or any of the million or so possibilities.

378,497748481,1,2017-6,United States,"As with the more popular park in Orlando, this park is a horrible place to go. The long wait for rides of very short duration are a real problem for the children. This is made worse with absence of any real fast pass service. We found that the information posted on the estimated wait times was highly inaccurate. While most of the posted times were actually shorter, we waited much longer than expected for two of the rides (in case the wait was 1 1 2 hours when the posted time was 40 minutes). The monitors do not measure the children waiting in line for a ride until the end of the line meaning they can wait for 2 hours to go on a ride and then be told they can't ride it. Food is another huge problem. As with all the Disney parks, it is awful and extraordinarily expensive. However, the lines in the cafeterias are poorly managed. The offerings are very limited and only one type of food can be found at any single location. This means that one child can't have a hot dog and another a pizza at the same time (try finding two kids to agree on what to eat). The restaurants are reservation only and fully booked in advance. On the other hand, and unlike the US parks, you can bring in food from the outside. Many people did. If we had known we could, the trip would have been more enjoyable.The one area Disneyland Paris truly was better than the US parks is in the merchandise offered.

There was a lot of rides closed (Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, the Chapparal theatre). Of the rides that were open, there were HUGE queues. Minimum of 50 min, mostly in the hot sun. The queues just to get the  fast  passes were about 1 2 hour. And fast passes were turned off by about 2:30pm on at least three of the rides that we saw (keep in mind the park is open until 11pm). Even the queue for the merry go round was about 1 2 hour! We thought we'd go on the Railroad, but we're told that even the wait for that was an hour (!!??). The rides themselves didn't look that great anyway, compared to any theme park in Australia. No big rollercoasters (in the Disney Park. We didn't go to the studios). Maybe geared towards smaller kids. But I couldn't imagine spending a day queuing for so long with small kids. What was open though was the shops. So. Many. Shops. So many ways to spend your money on overpriced merch. So many restaurants too. The whole place seems to be geared towards getting people to part with their money.

After coming out of the queue, we were waiting at the ride entrance with kid for the rain to slow down before we can go somewhere. There were other families with kid too waiting. However the one staff lady came and started saying in a pretty rude tone that we cannot stand there . We are blocking the entrance . I understand we were blocking the entrance which under normal circumstances would have not done, if it wasn't raining heavily. Also due to rain there was no one coming in for that ride anyways. But still the lady staff did not budge and started again saying in angry tone to all kids and family to move away to somewhere else.We had to come out in rain with kid and look for some other shelter.

Good production value in terms of sets, sounds, character costumes etc.2. Fantastic fireworks show at the end (22:00)Cons:1. Not many rides for teens adults: There are around 6 rides in Disneyland (and around 5 in Walt Disney Studios) that can be enjoyed by those who are over 16. This means you're spending over   110 per person (for a 2 day 2 park ticket) for a maximum of 11 rides. And it's highly unlikely that you'll get a chance to go on all 11 rides in the days that you're visiting as at least 2   3 of them will be  Under maintenance  and the remaining will have ridiculous wait times!2. Terribly overcrowded: Average wait times of over 90 minutes for the best rides and that's just what's communicated up front via the app or the signboards at the entrance to the ride. We joined a queue when the wait time was supposed to be 40 minutes and waited for over an hour before we got on the ride. Fastpass tickets regularly sell out and some of the key attractions in Walt Disney Studio don't have fastpass facility.3. Food Drink is 4 to 5 times more expensive: Water is    3.29! You'll have to queue for an average of 40 minutes to pay an extortionate amount for downright terrible food. On day 2, we learnt our lesson and brought food from outside.In summary, you're going to end up paying a lot of money for accommodation, food and tickets to come to a theme park where you'll get a chance to ride on less than 3 decent rides a day!

This drives ALL the other rides to wait times of 90 120 min. You aren't going to ride many rides at that pace! The food is truly dreadful, and places that say they have a certain food or drink simply  run out  of chicken, or beer and you can't get it anymore.

You will always be surrounded by excited children, and you accept it. However, surrounded, knocked over, pushed, kicked and abused by teenage groups on school trips, while teachers and cast members look on is not acceptable.This is not the only unchallenged behaviour. Smoking is a real issue. I am not anti smoking, it is everyones choice. However, I would like to move to areas designated as non smoking, which I do. But many guest ignore the no smoking signs and light up anyway. In queues for rides, in queues of food or meeting characters, in children's play areas, walking around and even leaning on no smoking signs whilst lighting up.The problem isn't the guests. Most smokers on the continent are ignorant and wouldn't care. The problem is the cast members that allow this behaviour to go unchallenged.If you have issues with behaviour that is not challenged and is likely to ruin you holiday. Don't book Disneyland Paris.

Europapark is a much better experience.We took the hotel Cheyenne with park tickets formula at 782     for the two nights (  flight).You get a time slot for having breakfast (for us 9:30), nobody answer the reservation phone for the dinner, and buffet food quality is very low (breakfast and dinner).The room was ok (good).Back to the park: the easy pass (entrance at 8h, before official one at 10h) is a joke. Only three activities are open, of which one is under maintenance.Our daughter wanted to do the big thunder mountain. So we waited with hundreds of peoples at the entrance of Frontierland until it opened at 10h, we waited again almost an hour in raw, and just before we could take it, it had a technical problem and they sent every body out!

449,465272408,1,2017-3,United Kingdom,"Attached is a letter that I wrote to Disneyland Paris summarizing my experiences there. I hope it is helpful to other prospective visitors. Dear Disneyland Paris, I am writing to you to inform you of the discriminatory and unacceptable actions of your employees against guests with disabilities. I am an adult (age 23) wheelchair user who visited your park on Saturday, 4 March, 2017 with my aide. The first disaster occurred upon attempting to enter the Disneyland hotel. Our hotel in Paris (the Shangri la) had arranged with our driver and with the Disneyland hotel for us to enter the park through the Disneyland hotel for wheelchair accessibility reasons. Shangri la gave Disneyland our names and information. We were stopped by security, and even after presenting our passports and my wheelchair, we were denied access into the hotel area and forced to enter the park through less accessible entrance. The second problem occurred with security and bag check. There was no clear line for wheelchair users and the employees ushering us in were uninformed. Because I was carrying a bag, I was asked after a long wait to join the wheelchair inaccessible line in the pouring rain, which caused further delays. Nearly half an hour later, we were finally able to attend the park. The third problem was inside the park at the information desk, where I experienced great difficulty obtaining a priority pass, despite having arrived prepared with ample documentation. Although I am above average height (165cm), the desk was so high that I could barely make eye contact with the employee attending to us, who was extremely rude and refused to speak with or look at me, only addressing my aide and asking her to sign everything. I am a university educated adult (who will soon earn a master   s degree) with a physical disability, but I was treated as though I were a child or had an intellectual disability. I was also informed on your website that my aide could enter the park free, but was told that this was not possible once I tried to enter the park and could not receive a refund.The fourth problem was the lack of accessible ramps and misinformation given by employees. There were few signs directing us to accessible entrances, and employees were unhelpful in guiding us to wheelchair ramps, either shrugging or blatantly giving misinformation when they did not know the answer. Many of the few ramps that were available were steeper than legal regulations mandate and were difficult to navigate.The fifth and most discriminatory problem was the treatment I received by employees who were managing the rides. This happened at multiple attractions.After entering Peter Pan   s wheelchair accessible entrance, I was asked by an attendant to wait for several minutes. When he finally returned, I handed my priority pass to him, expecting to board the ride. He shook his head and said,    People like you aren   t allowed on this ride.    I explained that I could transfer myself from the wheelchair to the ride, but he responded that his    boss    told him not to let wheelchair users enter. He said if I wished to enter the ride, I could wait in the standard queue. I explained to him that my wheelchair would not fit in the standard queue. He shrugged, said,    That   s the way it is,    and walked away.At It   s a Small World, I entered the accessible entrance and patiently waited to board the boat. I was asked by two different employees who were not in contact with each other if I needed a    special    boat or if I could board a    normal    one. I told them that I was capable of entering the normal boat. They told me my wait time was two minutes, but proceeded to keep me waiting for fifteen minutes before they got me a    special    boat, which I did not need.At Autopia, there was a trash bin placed on the wheelchair ramp that blocked my entrance to the attraction. I attempted to get the attention of the employees, who looked at me but did not move the bin. Once I entered the Autopia car, a female attendant moved my wheelchair directly into the rain. When my aide complained afterward, the attendant rudely said,    This is not my problem.    My wheelchair was soaked, despite the fact that ample sheltered space was available to park the chair.The worst experience I had (and the reason we promptly exited the park afterward) was at the Indiana Jones roller coaster ride at 3:00 3:40pm. I entered the wheelchair accessible entrance and waited behind about five other guests. The attendant asked for my name and priority pass, which I provided. After the guests before me boarded the ride, she told me that my aide and I would be next. Afterward, she said I needed to wait longer, and switched twice with two other attendants, who told me the same thing. I proceeded to wait for approximately 40 minutes, even though I was next in line while FORTY OTHER GUESTS WHO HAD ARRIVED AFTER US were allowed to board. The park was not very busy, so if the normal line had been accessible, the wait would have been shorter. I asked several times why I could not board, and the employees said,    There are many people here,    refusing to give me an answer. I patiently explained that there were only two of us and that I could easily transfer onto the ride, but they said that my wheelchair was a problem. When I was eventually granted access, there was no one behind us in line. Literally every single person who had arrived after us had already gone on the ride. When I told the employees that what they had done was irresponsible, they verbally mocked me.The constant discrimination I faced in your park is ableist, illegal, and embarrassingly outdated. Your disorganized Paris employees made it clear that I was not a welcomed guest and treated me with disdain and disgust, as though my disability was a burden with which they were forced to deal, rather granting me the equal respect that I am entitled to as a human being. As someone who has previously enjoyed countless positive experiences at Disneyland Anaheim, I was outraged by the way I was treated in your Paris park. I demand an answer and for your park to be held accountable. I can be contacted at the following addresses and expect your explanation and resolution immediately.

On arrival we were given our meal vouchers (full board so two meals a day plus the 'free' breakfast) and told to make reservations at the concierge. The only slot they had available was one the following night despite our hotel having two restaurants, the second of which was always empty. Shame they didn't use it for over spill and double the capacity for the buffet. No others slots at any restaurant for the whole trip which meant our meal plan was useless, our food bill was doubled after we had to buy separately at non meal plan restaurants.  45% of the attractions where closed for refurbishment or broken which left very little to do and very long queues if you wanted to do it. Rides were incredibly short in duration if you did go on one. The parks look very run down and tired with the castle's moat empty of water, very little Disney atmosphere around.  The weekend boasted a St.David's day theme however all we saw were five huts selling welsh tea and love spoons that were closed until the evening (unless you count the weather which was definitely Welsh themed!) In the evening we planned to watch the light show on the castle. It was hard to find out a time as all information only gave 'end of the day'. No mention if that's end of visitor hours or magic hours (It turns out it 9:30ish) but left after getting repeatedly stood on and people climbing over the pushchair and hitting my toddler in order to get a better smoking spot in the crowd.Smoking restrictions are not followed anywhere in the park which is horrible when you're trying to eat or queue. Security is poor going into the parks which makes you wonder why they bother as most people are waved through unchecked even after the machine flagging you up. One guard said he needed to check me then said he couldn't be bothered after all. Extortionate prices in the hotel shops...5 Euro for bag of Doritos! They make the most out of their hostages. The train station is a short walk and has a newsagents with a better and cheaper selection as well as a sandwich place with some very tasty baguettes. Even the vending machines are better value.On the day of checkout I asked if it was possible to have a late checkout and was told they were too busy to deal with doing it. The people in the queue next to me were asking if they could leave their luggage after checkout while they went into the park for the rest of their day and were also told by staff that they were too busy to deal with the request despite it being given as a perk of staying at a park hotel.The room was a decent size however the beds were small and the windows in our room didn't close properly. We kept the heating on to compensate but the squeaking from the system was too much to bear. The bird song that is played through the speakers all night kept waking me up due to the open window and the carpet looked like it hadn't been hoovered in a month as there were desiccated pieces of food under the table and by the sides of the bed.Disneyland Paris is really letting the brand down as far as the parks go, it's worlds away from Orlando.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

However, from there, things not so positive.We live in the digital age. Well we might, but Disneyland Paris clearly don't. We were bombarded by emails helpfully telling us our booking was confirmed, then periodically as our trip drew nearer, reminding us how close it was, and what we should book (restaurants particularly, I'll come back to that).In every email there was a reminder that we must PRINT   our confirmation letter to present at the hotel, and other Disney check in. Incredible   we me must print it, despite having the confirmation on at least 3 different devices. For what it's worth, the 'confirmation letter' seemed to contain a reference but then only tell us how to book restaurants   by telephone. But now we've been I can see why the need to book restaurants in advance was so frequently highlighted.In the confirmation emails it also mentioned the App to download. My instant reaction was 'great   I will surely be able to sign in by entering my booking reference and be able to download my entire itinerary including all tickets'. Alas no, this App just tells helps you navigate around the park and give you real time information on ride queue times. Nothing personalised whatsoever. So away we go, armed with plastic wallets containing travel booking confirmations whilst at least utilising the Eurostar App which does cater for digital tickets. The Eurostar Disney Express experience was a good one, checking in our luggage at the Disney counter in Ashford, receiving all our menu plan vouchers and park tickets, and handing over at the other side, before heading straight into the park which was the big benefit of that service. Of course at the park, we're using small paper tickets which we have to keep safe for 3 days as well as carrying a wallet full of menu plan paper vouchers.After first afternoon at the park we returned to the Hotel (Disney New York Hotel   I'll review that separately). It was 5pm and we spoke with Concierge to book a restaurant for that evening. We were informed that nothing at hotel possible before 9.30pm and earliest we could get elsewhere in our meal plan was 9pm, which is late for our 5 year old   especially after a long day. We learnt very quickly and booked all our meals for the remainder of our stay at that time.Now....anticipating the answer being along the lines of we were warned to book restaurants in advance (by phone), my wife is a vegetarian with a mushroom allergy. But of course the menu's for the restaurants aren't even available on the really helpful App, so it's actually quite difficult to book in advance   and especially when you don't know what menu you can pick from at each restaurant with your meal plan. Really the information you get is quite appalling.To the parks themselves. Maybe I didn't read the small print properly, but we understood that as Disney Hotel guests we got access to the parks between 8am and 10am before the general public arrived. The reality is that only one park is open for that, and of that park, only half of that is open, and of that half, only half of the rides were open. The queuing was long as expected with it being half term in UK and France, but the queue for some of the Fast Pass tickets was also unnecessarily long at times and again leaves you wondering why those sort of functions can't be managed digitally. Certainly I don't think we made the most of our trip to Disney because of the lack of ease in doing most things.Overall I'm glad we went and had the experience, but there is no way we would go again while the park continues to live in the dark ages.",Disneyland_Paris,3,hotel disnei book room park stai dai food meal wait breakfast disneyland time kid pari

There were queues every where right from for entering the park to each & every ride. Most of the time you spend standing in queues rather than enjoying the rides. There is lot of improvement needed in that area considering the people travel from all over the world & end up standing in queues. I will not recommend to queue for any rides as they are nothing extraordinary and can be done at any other amusement work of much smaller scale. Pick the attractions which are theme based like PeterPan, Buzz Light Year & are unique to Disney. It is not worth to stand in queue for the meet & greet Disney characters.

We have visited the park over the last decade and the park has not developed in 10 years apart from more cafes and more gift shops. The worst thing is the queues which really reduced the fun of the day. There are simply not enough rides in the parks. On our first day we did the the Disneyland park and three major rides were closed Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean. The children were so disappointed, and there was no warning when we booked the tickets that the main attractions would be closed. As these rides were closed the queues were even worse at the other rides with queues of 85 and 90 mins for a four minute ride. None of the water fountains were working when we were there and the rides looked scruffy and in need of a paint. When we asked why we were told the park was awaiting its 25th anniversary refurb which is also why the rides were closed. This was not warned on the website or reflected in the prices. The second day we went into the studio park and the Tram studio tour was closed. The queues were terrible for the other rides with crushers coaster being 85mins, the Toy Story RC ride being 80mins. After two rides the children couldn't face it anymore and wanted to go back to the hotel.

And most of attractions are fabulous.BUT this is not park for kids and also grown ups. In winter time, when there is less crowd than in summer for many attractions waiting time exceeded 60 minutes, fast pass tickets were not available after 30 minutes of park opening and longest waiting time was The Twilight Zone exceeding 2 hours!!!! Even for making photo with Disney characters you should stand in long queue. We skipped the longest waiting time attractions and in whole day managed 13 attractions so on average it was still close to 50 minutes waiting time per attraction. And because of this comes another problem   while in queue many people smoke or drink alcohol and there is literally human s h i t on ground!!! Yes   staff is dealing very professionally, because they have sand (so this must be common) to cover and remove but nevertheless this is not you expect in kids park...Some advice: best ride rock 'n' roll   this is fantastic and later in night there is less waiting time. For eating   look for McDonald as there prices are not exaggerated or better bring with you soda, snacks, some fruits and eat while stand in queue. Do not waste time on Parachute drop   long waiting time and no fun for kids or grown ups.And final advice   for some strange reason the park ticket prices are different based on CURRENCY an COUNTRY selection   as online payment system was rejecting euro currency and my country selection I tried UK pound un UK country as my residence and the park ticket price after hefty bank commissions was still 15 euro less than if I would pay in euros...

466,460682485,2,2017-2,United Kingdom,"I am certain that when Walt Disney imagined his first theme park, he had no idea how successful it would be or that it would spawn further theme parks and resorts around the globe. However I'm equally certain that the idea of building a Disney theme park at the end of a forlorn railway line, in the middle of nowhere outside the capital city of a temperate   generally cold   northern European country would have been the last thing in his head (who knows, if the stories are true and technology moves forward enough, we may actually one day find out)Disneyland Paris is a misnomer, its like saying Wembley Luton. It sits outside of the city so involves a 40 minute train ride from Gare de Nord, or a    70 taxi journey from CDG airport, or an uncomfortable coach ride and THAT is just the beginning of the cash that will soon be leaking from your pockets or purses should you choose to visit the park.DP is nothing more than a testament to the corporate greed of an organisation that is hell bent on cynically exploiting children's dreams whilst simultaneously extorting as much money as possible through Disney branded merchandise.The cost of entry varies (anything from    40   60) and as soon as you are through the gates the task of getting you to part with as much cash as possible in the shortest possible time begins. The bombardment is perpetual, from the saccharin sweet schmaltzy Muzak constantly piped through speakers throughout the park to the gaggle of costumed cartoon celebrities and the Disney shops, Disney themed restaurants and fast food kiosks.Does it sound like I am bitter? Too right I am, especially as there is NO INDICATION before you buy your ticket WHICH of the rides WILL NOT be functioning that particular day.February 14th the following rides were closedPirates of the CaribbeanThunder MountainSpace Mountain 2Three 'thrill rides' that most visitors actually want to go, which meant that the thousands of visitors had to choose alternative experiences, leading to waiting times of well over an hour for each ride and the FAST PASS tickets for all the other 'thrill rides' being completely 'SOLD OUT' by noon. I was lucky enough to get one of the last FAST PASS tickets for one ride @ 11.45am (just one hour and fifteen minutes after the park opened) and was told to return for my ride at 17:05 So I had to kick my heels for well over 5 hours, waiting around   unable to go on anything but the really rubbishy rides   because the queues were too long.I calculated that the average person, would only manage to go on a maximum of four thrill rides in a seven hour period   if they were lucky and decided to eat on the hoof. Ridiculous.So what else is there to do, while you wait for your FAST PASS slot to arrive? Well, you could eat, or walk around from ride to ride shaking your head at the length of the queues, or you could eat, you could go on the only experience on the park with NO WAITING time: Armageddon (Yeah, no wonder   I mean does anyone even remember that film?) or you could eat and have a drink, you could try to avoid being beaten about the face by kids off their heads on sugar and armed with lightsabres, or you could sit down and eat in one of the restaurants, watch overweight 23 year women in Minnie Mouse ears attempting to eat foot long hotdogs, you could eat something, or gasp in amazement as obese LARPers in Darth Vader masks attack each other in the queue for soft drinks.Yep, it really is that much fun.So, when the allocated time for my ride came around I was ready. However, because of the closure of the better rides, the running time of the others were cut short to help accommodate everyone.

Even little cafes supply heating these days for guests sitting outside   after the large entry fees and food costs I think Disneyland could afford to ensure their customers are not snap frozen while lined up.The park was very busy despite our visit falling on a cold, wintery weekday   yet only four ticket booths were open, making lines for entry tickets very long.This was annoying as Disneyland was the only attraction we visited that would not accept tickets on the mobile phone. This meant we could not take advantage of the much cheaper online tickets and avoid the entry lines (no access to a printer). Several of the rides we were interested in were closed   we had checked in advance so knew this   then on arrival another major ride was out of action. It reopened an hour later prompting a stampede to line up.Many guests used Fast Pass   this works well if you study up the rides in advance and then strategically use your pass on a popular ride.We found staff at the walk through Swiss Family Robinson house quite rude. They abruptly cut off entry while three staff members had a five minute conversation, ignoring the line completely.On the plus side, The park was clean, well set out and offered a good variety of rides for kids of all ages. We travelled by train from Paris: tickets for two adults and two children cost thirty euro each way. We decided on the entry to just the main park   this worked out well because as it turned out, we didn't have time to queue for all rides in the main park.However after our experience I would recommend buying online tickets to save cash and not visiting on a cold day as Disney doesn't seem to care if guests are snap frozen.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I've visited Disneyland in L.A. and visited Walt Disney World on 5 occasions staying on site on three occasions. I love Disney but Disneyland Paris was a total shambles.It looked great with the decorations and festive atmosphere etc. but it was horrendously busy. We got in at 0910 with the park opening 10 minutes earlier and queues had already built up. We went to the Studios first and the RocknRoller Coaster was a 45 mins. by that time. By later in the day the queues were simply unacceptable. I'm used to Disney queues around the world but 180 min queue for a five minute ride is simply idiotic. Yes, we went during the French Christmas holiday period but there were far too many people in that park. I dread to think what would have happened if they'd had to evacuate quickly.We went over to the main Park at lunchtime to let our 9 year old ride the thrill rides   that was a joke. He's 142 cm's as I measured him to be sure. He was refused access on Indiana Jones with a minimum limit of 140 by a totally disinterested staff member who actually hit his head with the measuring stick on the way past. This was queue management and nothing else. Star Tours was closed for refurbishment so that was out. Big Thunder Mountain was shut due to a fault so we went to Space Mountain   also shut due to a fault. So we had a park stuffed to bursting point and the four biggest rides all out of limits.Decided to have some lunch and see if the rides would restart. That was a joke. Every place was bursting at the seams with folks sitting eating on the floors or outside in sub zero temperatures as there were no seats. Ended up with burger and chips outside in the cold. No patio heaters or shelter. Just left to get on with it by staff who couldn't care less and were totally run off their feet.Big Thunder Mountain did re open but immediately shot up to 2 hours wait so we gave it a miss.In short this was the biggest waste of nearly   200 I've ever spent. I WILL be back to WDW but I'll give the money grabbing shambles which is Disneyland Paris a miss in future. I'll never complain about queueing in the heat of Florida again.Sorry Disney you seriously angered me and let down you're company name in a way I wouldn't have imagined. 0 10 from us and sort out your numbers before somebody gets seriously injured.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
478,450009074,2,2016-12,United States,"It just didn't have the same charm. My first job I worked at Disneyland in California for three years, and I've been to Walt Disney World five times. This just didn't live up to the Disney name. Now, let me just say up front that there are two big caveats. 1. It was FREEZING cold that day. The weather forecast said the high was 28 deg.2. I don't speak hardly any French. I don't think that made too much of a difference, but maybe it did and I didn't realize it.Okay, now onto my review:I started out in Disney Studios. Most attractions had a 5   10 minute wait, so I was able to see everything I wanted in less than 2hrs. It is maybe half as big as the Disney Studios at WDW and has almost nothing worth seeing other than maybe the Ratatouille ride (which was closed when I was there). Then I made my way over to Disneyland. It was the same there where each attraction had only a 5   10 minute wait. I was able to ride everything I wanted to twice. Now let me say there are some good parts. Their castle is amazing, Discoveryland is probably the best version of Tomorrowland that I've ever seen, and I think I like their Pirates better where it's backwards from Disneyland in CA so you have the skeleton pirates at the end instead of the beginning. However, the food is god awful and way overpriced, and at least when I was there (and again, it was freezing cold out) there was no atmosphere entertainment which is a big part of what makes Disneyland at Walt Disney World feel so magical.So my overall thoughts are that 1. there are hardly any major E ticket rides. Even with Star Tours and Big Thunder closed, they really only have five. Overall it felt like Disneyland didn't really have any magic to it at all. There were large stretches of the park between Adventureland and Frontierland where there was just nothing. The cast members were all hiding inside where it was warm and I don't blame them one bit. Considering how empty the park was and how cold it was outside I would have done the same thing. So maybe on a different day when the cast members are out and about the park would feel different.2. Disney Studios was just awful. It has all the charm of a post office. It's the most bland, boring looking Disney park I've ever seen. They need to add Soarin and the real Cars Land as soon as possible.So those are my thoughts. Maybe the cold got to me and I wasn't in the right frame of mind. Maybe the language barrier caused me to miss out on some of the best parts of the park. But unfortunately, I really didn't like it, and even if I ever go back to Paris I don't think I'd go back to their Disneyland, which absolutely breaks my heart to say. :(",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I reported this incident to one employee who did not take me seriously; I then reported this to three employees at the gate who took a description. I also emailed a complaint to Disney Paris via their website  awaiting a response.Separately, wait times are inaccurate. Hotel guests are issued vouchers to fast pass any ride any time, throwing off crowd control measures from regular fast passes.

Perhaps investment in a few more quick turnaround, high volume attractions would help alleviate this or simply set a cap on the number of visitors allowed in in any one day.Our experience of the food though was far worse. The prices are extortionate, 35 euros per person for a buffet is a joke. Some of the eateries were so expensive that we just glanced at the menu, laughed and walked away.

I did complain to Disney and had a somewhat unsatisfactory response. I am disappointed to say that the situation hasn't improved, in fact it seemed much worse. Smoking in the park is supposed to be within very limited designated areas only, but this is not policed and as such I felt like I had a lung full of smoke wherever I went, even in queues for rides. Just utterly grotesque in a family park and I would like to see Disney step up and do more to control this unsociable habit in their park.Security in the light of recent world affairs is clearly being taken seriously by Disney, with more intense security checks to enter the park. Yes, this is good and reassuring even if the ques can be very long. However, there are some issues with security, in that checks and procedures could be very inconsistent. We returned to the park one evening to view the fireworks and dozens of people were bypassing security by entering via the exit! assuming this was the protocol for evening entry we followed. Just as a young female security officer returned and went crazy at us. 'Fair enough' I said, 'but you must have just missed at least 30 people walk past'.

I think it was her who had a problem, with her attitude! needless to say this was very upsetting for my daughter and very unprofessional I felt.Lastly, I will say that the queuing situation hasn't improved. They seem to be very inefficient at the turn around between rides and getting people on and off seems to take longer than the ride itself! We went to LA Disney a few years ago, I don't remember queuing much at all. The Americans seem to have things running like a well oiled machine, where as the French take a much more unhurried approach.Overall, you can't help getting caught up in all the Disney magic and we did have a good time. Would we return? I don't think we will go back to Disneyland Paris any time soon.

When too many people try to come in, the staff has a terrible time ensuring the safely of handicapped individuals.

We were told the usual entrance that handicapped people use was broken and we had to walk around thousands of people to gain our early access rights. Not 20 minutes later, these same  broken  gates were opened to let day tickets holders in. We have been season tickets holders for years and have never been treated so rudely and without care to physical challenges. There are many wonderful people who do work at Disney, especially the people tasked with getting us on the rides, but management is still very Parisienne in it's attitudes as to how to help people. The attitude we constantly hear from these people is that if you don't like it, don't come here. Not the attitude for the happiest place on Earth. Four hour waits for rides were happening in a very overcrowded park. If I had paid EUR 90 to get in and waited that long...

Many very dated and dull. Not enough to do and see for this length of trip.

No queue less than 30minutes even for the more minor attractions, over an hour (frequently 90 120minutes) for the big thrill rides.

Queued nearly 1 hour on one occasion to then have the ride fail and be closed!! What a terrible way to spend a holiday! Reduced me to tears that day!!Similar experience on Crushes Coaster!Where was the Frozen experience?!?! Ok there was a float but no other reference other than dresses for    80!Food overpriced and generally rubbish. Shops everywhere selling almost nothing other than overpriced Disney tat.No magic, no excitement.There could be entertainment for the queuing masses, street entertainment, original shops, disney characters walking the park (people employed to do this rather than stand manning yet another stall of rubbish merchandise), more shows catering for larger crowds (Go to Puy to Fou it's soooooooo much better) .....

Well firstly can I say that this trip is costly. Everything about Disneyland is expensive. It cost us over   50 per ticket for entrance into the park and what do you get for this??? It seemed like we were walking around a park with hardly any good rides. My first impressions was that it was dated. Have they not updated this park since it first opened 20 plus years ago. Disney you really need to move with the times. The castle is plastic looking and not real like. Where is the Disney characters waving from the balcony? The rides are out dated. We queued for some ride called Le Pays Des Contes De Fee, according to their leaflet it's not to be missed. Well it a small boat ride around some lame small wooden scenes from Disney movies. My daughter could have made in nursery. Where is the animations. Where is the 3D cinematic rides that take you through a journey of Disney film adventures. Where is the holographic Minnie and Mikey waving at you as enter the park? Where is the Elsa and Anna Characters? Your most successful Disney film to date and you haven't decided to make a frozen castle? Where is the magic? All I saw was a couple of unpopular Disney characters in the park where you have to que hours to have a pic with. Mickey and Minnie well expect over a 2 hour queue to meet them. You should have a proper theatre auditorium where visitors can sit properly to see a property show. It seems Disney you have lost your magic, This park is not about the children this is a money spinner. Everything is about making money. We booked to have lunch with the Disney princesses 70 EUROS PER PERSON! The kids menu was Cinderella bites to start and pasta for main. Well what came out for our young kids to eat was laughable. Quails eggs and a load of salad leaves in a bowl. You call that Cinderella bites. Kids don't eat food like this. The pasta a tiny bowl of plain pasta with a small portion of tomato sauce on the side. What a disgrace. The manager said but you pay for the princess experience. Oh what Cinderella Ariel and sleeping beauty walking around the restaurant for half an hour. WHERE IS ELSA AND ANNA or your up to date characters. They should all be in the park every single day. This is a Sham! Sorry but I truly think Walt Disney would be turning in his grave. Bring back the real magic of Disney where kids truly experience good food and great quality attractions and entertainment. Why don't you bring in a macdonalds into the park and a pizza express?

Many of these attractions have either an EU or a French twist, adding a bit of character to the park. There are, however, less shows and experiences than either Disneyland or Walt Disney World. This means that if you are not into the ride experience there is less for you to do. There are also very few rides that pregnant women can go on (not normally a problem, but this time it was an issue).The big drawback with this park is the guests smoking. I wasn't able to go on Pirates of the Caribbean and was pointed towards a waiting area. This should have been a nice area to sit and wait for your party but the benches there were taken up with people so desperate for a cigarette that they lit up as they walked out of the ride. If this wasn't disgusting enough, the  cast members  (a term I use very loosely here) ignore individuals who smoke, walking past people smoking in the middle of Main Street or outside of the rides rather than in the designated smoking areas.

I grew up going to the US parks (been to WDW and DL at least 20 times in my lifetime), haven't been to any of the Disney parks located in Asia... I'm mentioning this as a reference point.Returning to Disneyland Paris was a terrible experience, it was my birthday and my girlfriend's first time ever at a Disney Park (I wanted to take her to WDW, but she's from South America and doesn't have a US visa).The two main problems that we encountered where that there are many rude cast members (I would say about 40% of the ones we interacted with) and also that rides kept breaking down.Our first ride was Buzz Lightyear's at Tomorrowland.... it got stuck for at least 2 minutes halfway thru.The same happened with Haunted Mansion later in the evening... we only rode it once, and it got stuck twice! For about 2 minutes the first time and 5 minutes the second.The Ratatouille ride was also out of service for a couple of hours right in the middle of the day... we later returned and it was working fine.Had a reservation made over a month in advance at Chez Remy, it was for dinner but since we rode the attraction at about 3PM, we asked if we could see the place and the host with a smirk replied that it was  better  to wait to see it later, at the time we had our reservation so that it was a  surprise  for us... a  polite  way of saying  no ... because of this attitude we decided to have dinner elsewhere.We were also treated rudely by another cast member at the Aerosmith ride... I don't even want to write it because it will probably take too much of my time and I don't really want to remember it.After that I simply tried to stop interacting with cast members.Guests were also smoking everywhere around the park... something you don't usually see at the US parks...

The really bad thing for me were the toilets in fantasyland they were disgusting unclean and no toilet roll in any of the toilets, for a place like Disney that is a very big let down .

Another thing that should be mentioned is the food.They have plenty of themed restaurants but we found that they all served the exact same poor quality food!We ended up living off chicken burgers for 4 days as everything else was disgusting!The meals were ridiculously overpriced,it would have been acceptable had the food been nice but it was truly appalling!In the 5 park restaurants that we dined in,the menus were hard to understand with unhelpful staff.At one of restaurants we even got food poisoning from eating underprepared chicken which is totally unacceptable for Disneyland Parks.They should be ashamed!However we weren't even offered an apology by the company and it was 2 months until we heard a reply which was  we have found no hygiene problems with the kitchen the meals were prepared in Overall this park is disappointing and I would advise you to not go here,it's not magical and you are just wasting your time!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

All of the main attractions have been there years and as a result the park felt like it was 20 years out of date (e.g Armageddon FX show, Indiana Jones, Aerosmith R&R coaster, even Space Mountain). The one new ride (Finding Nemo themed coaster) had a wait of 90mins ! Most restaurants were the same (Videopolis is like something out of the 80's). All of this would be fine if the prices reflected. Tickets for 3 adults and 2 kids cost in excess of   500 for a 3 day pass ! This park needs to be updated quickly. They still sell hard copies of photos taken on the rides and had no facilities to send these electronically via wifi etc. As a result, I didn't see one person buy these photo's. Even the quality of the soft toys on offer has diminished from ones we've bought previously.

There is also zero variety in the shopping that can be done and every shop sells the exact same thing.Disney theater shows some awesome Disney short films, worth seeing.

554,402462585,2,2016-3,United Kingdom,"This was our second visit to Disneyland but the first with young children of our own   our 5 year old daughter. On this visit, we were also accompanied by 13 other family members, two of which are disabled. Our first visit was in August 2008 during their 15 year anniversary. That visit was FAR better than this visit. In 2008, the characters were everywhere, wandering the park and mingling with visitors. You could always see at least one, wherever you looked. This visit, though, was extremely disappointing.We spent 2 days at the park and, the parade excepted, saw 5 characters in total. Our daughter was full of excitement at the prospect of meeting her favourite characters. On the first day, we saw sleeping beauty flash by, surrounded by other staff, as she made her way through one of the side gates. That was it. On the second day, we arrived before the park opened with the promise of meet and greets with the characters. Our daughter joined the queue for Minnie Mouse and JUST got to the front of the queue before the meet and greet was over. The look on the faces of the other children behind her was unforgettable as they were told Minnie had run out of time. It also meant that our daughter couldn't meet the other characters, although she did catch a glimpse of Mickey, Pluto and Donald as they were whisked away from their meet and greets. Again, the parade excepted, we saw no other characters for the rest of the day.On this visit, the park was clearly not expecting the number of visitors. Our 1st day at the park was the Tuesday after Easter Monday. Despite having wheelchair bound family members and two others (myself included) that have difficulty standing for long periods, it took 90 minutes just to get through security. The queues were MASSIVE. I'm aware that, at the time, security was elevated but the number of staff processing visitors was woeful. It was nearly lunchtime before we finally got into the park itself so decided to get an early lunch in one of the restaurants. Again, the queues were tremendous. There were TWO members of staff on the tills (despite there being a large number of tills available   definitely more than 10) and it took 45 minutes in total before we were sat down and eating. The food was acceptable but not exceptional.On both days, we had to visit City Hall to obtain passes for our wheelchair users and for the family members who are unable to comfortably stand for long periods. Ironically, the queue for City Hall was lengthy on the first day but we obtained passes without issue upon presenting disabled badges and doctors letters. The second day, the City Hall queue was non existent (likely because we arrived early) but had to jump through hoops to obtain disabled passes. After seeing several people and sifting through scanned letters, sick notes, doctors letters, occupational health reports and hospital reports, we finally obtained passes, although the process meant we lost 90 minutes of park time. Clearly, wheelchairs, disabled badges and doctor letters are not enough proof for some members of Disney staff.The rides are amazing, but most are designed for adults so the young children rely on seeing the characters for their entertainment. For this reason, and putting up with a sulking 5 year old after being utterly disappointed, I can't give any more than 2 5. It's likely we'll visit again, but only when our daughter is old enough to appreciate the rides and during the summer when the characters are more likely to be around the park.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

It was more like a very cheap fairground attraction. The fact that Frontierland was a virtual building site was compounded if you took the Disney Railroad around the park since a huge part of the line consists of travelling past the boarded up building work.

It is obvious that with so many rides being shut, resulted to huuuuuge lines for the rest attractions!!!! For example we spent around 45 minutes to one hour waiting at the queue for a 3 4 minutes ride at the Dumbo the elephant or the Autopia. Same situation at the restaurants (which we visited after 15:00 hrs to avoid the crowds) where we spent around 45 minutes to order burger and chips. From the other hand, most of the rides suitable for small kids in the Fantasyland were open (with big queues of course). Highly recommend the Tea Cups, The Petit Train de Cirque and the cruises  Le Pays des contes de fees  the  it's a small world  and of course the Pirates of the Caribbean !!! The staff was a bit disorganised with lack of common sense at some rides   at the restaurant where we had our lunch. Security is very heavy at the entrance with scanners for both visitors and their bags that makes your visit safe. Not necessary to recommend spending the whole day at the park and close the visit watching the magnificent  Disney Dreams  (around 23:00 hrs). The show contains fireworks, water fountains, laser, music and other special effects!!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Surely it would have been within their competence to do the maintenance in the low periods rather than when people really want it i.e. during the summer holidays.As a result, those rides which were open had long queues as people tried to compensate with what was left. If you get there really early, just after opening then queues are short, but this does not last long as more people turn up.We ate at the Market House Deli which was OK in that the sandwiches were reasonable, but the shortage of tables meant that there was often an ugly free for all when a table did become clear. The cleaners also did not feel it was their job to clean the tables. In fact at one point a cleaner picked something up from the floor and dumped it on the table I was sitting at rather than cleaning it up and putting it in the bin! The place was also severely understaffed in that the cashier had to handle the drinks orders as well which meant that the queue movement was slow.The  cast  members, or staff throughout the park also seemed to lack the ability to smile, as if it was too much for them.All in all, a disappointing experience and not what I would expect from a Disney experience.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I was queueing with my two year old who needed help, so I put all my things down on the ground and saw to him, and meanwhile someone came past the queue and stole my iphone, hat and jumper off the ground next to me. Nobody cared. I managed to find city hall, after being redirected four times, and they just wrote my number down on a piece of paper and a description   no help even though there are security guards EVERYWHERE   nobody was interested. I queued for three rides, Mickey mouse (40 minutes queue), the Teacups (25 minutes queue) and the Carousel (20 minutes queue) this was just after 10 in the morning, so we got there as early as it opened. Each ride was really fast   actually so fast I barely managed to take a few photos with my iphone (now stolen) before they ended   maybe 2 minutes maximum? I bought a hotdog at Casey's hotdogs, for 9.50euro (about 8 british pounds) and it was properly disgusting. The sausage was plastic, tough and rubbery, luke warm, and the bread was like plastic, tasteless, yeasty and boring. The  cheese  was nothing I had ever seen that came from an actual cow   more like yellow covered slime, and the crispy onions were saturated in greasy oil. I bought a small cup of popcorn for 5 euro, again, it was greasy, bland, tasteless and actually, I left it on a seat because I couldn't be bothered carrying it on all the queues, where I had to leave my 20 euro hired stroller behind and carry all my things, including my two year old son, through the enormous queues. My son wanted to meet Mickey Mouse, but there was a half an hour queue and I said no.

573,391653965,1,2016-6,United Kingdom,"I was recently made redundant from my job of 15 years. I have 2 daughters aged 24 and 21 and we are huge Disney fans. We have visited Orlando on a few occasions when they were younger. I decided that I would use some of my redundancy money to fund a Disney trip as a treat. I could not afford Orlando so we booked a trip to Disneyland Paris and the three of us were very excited about it. The trip was a catastrophic disappointment. We stayed at the New York Hotel which was lovely   no real complaints there. We were offered the free meal plan which I upgraded to the Plus Plan.We arrived on Tuesday 28th June quite late and decided we would go into Disney Village for our evening meal. We decided to use our vouchers at Annette's. Whilst the food was lovely the service was unacceptable. We were served by a young waiter who advised us what we could order from the menu. I explained that I am vegetarian and so he said I could have the Veggie Burger, I asked if if was possible to change the toppings on the burger, the response was  no . Nothing else, just  no . We ordered drinks and I ordered a lemon fanta. Again the response was  you can't have that on your meal plan . I was very taken aback as this is not the kind of service I expect when in Disney. The food was lovely but the service left me feeling like I was a pauper expecting welfare handouts. It sullied the whole meal. I would have been prepared to pay for anything extra we wanted but that clearly was not an option.Nevermind, we thought, tomorrow is another day. We'll have fun in Disney Studios. How wrong we were. We arrived at the park at 11.30am, attempted to get into a Cinemagique and Art of Animation experience to be told to come back at 12 o clock. We then moved onto and spent the first half an hour queueing to get into the Armageddon  ride . It was absolutely rubbish. We couldn't understand a word that was being said and had expected so much more based on our Orlando experience. The day then goes from bad to worse. We next went to the Rock n Roller Coaster and expected to queue for one hour according to the notices. However, the ride broke down and so it was more like 2 hours that we queued. We next went to the  Behind the Scenes  tram experience and queued up for 20 minutes to then be told to go away as the ride had broken down. We were feeling very despondent and let down by this time. We moved around to Crush's coaster and queued up for half an hour to be told again that the ride had broken down and to go away and come back later. We decided to go into the Toy Story section of the park. More disappointment when we realised the Indy Car ride was closed for refurbishment. Never mind we thought, we'll go on the Parashute Drop. Can you guess what happened? After 45 minutes of queueing we were told that the ride had broken down and to come back later. By now this had totally ruined our day. We decided to try Crush again and after one and half hours of queuing we managed to get on the ride. Earlier in the day, around 3 o clock we had tried to get a fastpass for Ratatouille as the queue time was 2 hours but even though the park had 4 hours before it closed there were no fast passes available. So we spent nearly 8 hours in Disney Studios and only managed to get on 3 rides. Not exactly Disney standards or our money's worth.We were still unsure about the meal plan after our experience at Annette's and so decided to pay for a meal at Planet Hollywood instead that evening to cheer ourselves up.The next day we went into Disneyland Park with hopes that we might have a good day. We queued for 45 minutes for Buzz Lightyear (the wait time said 15 minutes). My girls were excited for some of the bigger rides and so we raced over to Space Mountain: closed. More disappointment. We raced over to Star Tours: closed. It goes on: Casey Jr: closed. Big Thunder Mountain: closed. Pirate Galleon: closed. Robinson Tree House: Closed. Peter Pan: Closed. Riverboat landing: closed. What a huge disappointment. We spent 12 hours in the park and the only rides we managed to get on were Indiana Jones after a horrific queue (no wonder as no other thrill rides were open) and Pirates of the Caribbean. We tried to get a fastpass for Indiana Jones at 2pm and bearing in mind that the rides didn't close til 10 that evening there were none left!We also ate in Blue Lagoon and I ordered the only vegetarian dish available and it came in a fish sauce so couldn't eat it.The whole trip was a huge disappointment from start to finish. Well over 50% of the big thrill rides were closed and added to that the number of rides that broke down we only managed a measly 5 rides after spending a total of 20 hours in the parks.This trip was meant to be a memory making trip for my daughters and I and it made all the wrong sort of memories. I don't think a review can fully get across the true disappoinment of the trip.I feel that my money has been taken under false promises. We booked with the intention of getting a Disney experience.

I went there with two friends and was really looking forward to relive the experience. But when we arrived there we realized that approx. 80% of the roller coaster rides were closed (only one roller coaster in the park opened). There was no transparent communication to this extensive maintenance work. On the map you could see that the attractions marked with a tiny Mickey Mouse head were due to maintenance at some point in time but you had to walk the whole way to see if they were closed today or not. Additionally it was end of June   so you didn't expect such a high proportion of attractions to be closed in the mid of summer!It is also valuable to mention that throughout the whole park there is a ban on selfie sticks  for security reasons  and the value for money in the restaurants is really poor.From my point of view it is a nice experience for children.

We stood in line at the haunted house for close to an hour, with no information. And all I could think of was The Clash    should I stay or should I go   .Correct me if I'm wrong, but the parade was only half the length that it used to be, and the number of characters walking around in the park was very limited based on our earlier visits.The food was as always more than OK in most of the park, but our dinner in The Lucky Nugget Saloon was terrible. Our burgers were dry, and cold. And next time try to actually try to fry the fries. Also, it is quite easy to promise free refill of beverages when you are so understaffed that no one have the time to ask your guests if they want a refill.

We had both our kids (under 12) with us, and stayed at the Disneyland Hotel in the VIP section. The VIP package included unlimited fastpass for the FP attractions   which might have been cool if the FP attractions had generally been open (they are not   will explain in a bit). As an aside, the Disneyland hotel was lovely   and we were treated very well. Breakfast is included, and despite some renovations to the exterior and the closing of the California Grille   I thought the hotel exuded a nice charm more intimate than the Grand Floridian Florida. Its pricey   but its right next to the two parks (10 second walk) and I thought worth it if you are only going to be here once or rarely.As for the parks, well   the most important thing to stress is that the parks have significant potential, with some real highlights, and are the subject of massive investment & construction right now. That said, they are clearly woefully, and sometimes comically, mismanaged with excessive closures of kiosks and food locations, often apparently  don't give a crap  staff (there are exceptions to this), and significant deterioration of physical plant and rides. I wont take issue with the high food prices   gate prices are actually low here during the week and its an amusement park.The highlights positives: (1) In two words, DISNEY DREAMS. The castle laser and fireworks show, which is presented at park close (11:00 during my several days), is wondrous. Its sort of a combination of the Magic Kingdom Florida castle laser show and then the following fireworks   but better. It doesn't feature the beautiful song Wishes   but its an extravaganza not to be missed. and unique to the Paris park. A (2) Parade   its brief, and not dissimilar from the parades at the US parks, but we enjoyed it.(3) Pirates of Carribean   wow, a much longer version of the Florida ride and solid entertainment.(4) The castle   beautiful and unique.(5) Cleanliness   I have seen the complaints about the parks being filthy but they appeared clean to me.The lowlights:(1) Construction   to be honest, the parks are not worth visiting until Spring 2017. The main park's main rides are almost all closed. Closures included Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain RR, Star Tours, Peter Pan. RC Racers was closed at WDS. The parks are a giant construction zone right now   Frontier Town is essentially closed. And you can imagine what this does to crowding at open rides   nightmares!!(2) Staff   some were quite pleasant and greeting, but most are apathetic if not disgruntled. Def a MAJOR issue.(3) Wear and Tear   some of it is shocking. I noticed paint peeling off several rides for example. Check out the magic carpet rides   most cars missing tons of paint. You'd never see this in FL.(4) Food lines   out of control, with numerous eateries and kiosks randomly closed. Staffing shortages are really evident   including for food kiosks that require extensive labor such as making crepes. Still only worked by one person. Lots of crowd complaints on this. Some food lines exceeded an hour.(5) Rides breaking down   trust me. Went on Buzz Lightyear three times. Each time ride stopped several times. Same with the Haunted Mansion.

If you aim to go there to see Frontierland forget it, it's completely fenced off as are other attractions. I like to get my perspective of the park by travelling on the railway that goes through the different lands. Well, that was a waste of time. Two stations are closed and for a lot of the trip you are looking at a fence to hide the works that are being undertaken.And what about the parade? I used to enjoy the parade in the middle of the day. Now the parade is at 5.30, along with many others I was on my way home by then. For kids the parade is generally the highlight but I saw many parents on the train back to Paris, their kids were too tired to last until 5.30.On the upside, the Walt Disney Park next door was all open.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We understood why when we spent 90 minutes walking round from 5 p.m. to find the first 6 or 7 restuarants closed. Every one of thise had info boards about where was open, info that was nonsense, with different restaurants on each sign, many we'd been to and found shut. The person on the end of the phone number on the signs ( ring and book a table ) told us the names of  open  restaurants, that we'd been to and were shut and seemed to think it was our fault that ones that she had listed as open were shut!! She suggested a hot dog restaurant when we were looking for a meal. We finally were forced to have a  formule .

Please allow me to elaborate;Alladin, Peter Pan, Thunder Mountain, Star Wars, Rock'n'Roll coaster, Train stations, Pirate ship and the Tree were ALL to our disappointment closed. There was probably more, but these were the main rides that resulted in our compete disappointment.Apart from the program, there were no other signs that informed us of closure. It would have be nice to know bore our trip that the park was basically half closed.For example, we queued for the train for 30 minutes as we intended after a long hot day to hop on it to take us back to the entrance. As there were NO SIGNS informing us, when the train eventually turned up, it just went straight past our intended station so we ended up going full circle and wasting around 45 minutes.Besides from the disappointing ride closures for apparent 'refurbishment'   which we saw no work actually being done in our entire time there!!   the rides that were working broke down countless times.For example, on our second day which we spent in the Studios, we queued for the Toy Story Parachute ride... 20 minutes into queuing it broke down. We waited a further 10 minutes in the hope it would be quickly fixed. We gave up. On to the next one... Ratatouille. We queued for 45 minutes before it was announced that this too had broken down!! We waited another half an hour there, with absolutely no updates on the progress from staff, before we gave up. So in total, just under 2 hours completely wasted!!It is an absolute joke that we were charged full price for this.

Studios   I would recommend tower of terror and stunt show with Cars and bikes fire and stunts. Few kids rides in there and a huge play area which kids love. Not a very big park so easy to get round. Disney world   Bigger park this one. I recommend the main ride space mountain. Good all round set up for kids. Good bar street outside parks with shops and food places.

Among those closed were Disney Signature rides such as  Thunder Mountain  and  River Rapids  Some areas were closed for 'refurbishment'   loads of activity in evidence (NOT!) Wild West shoot out advertised but non existent and other shows simply not in operation. Apparently these closures have been known about for some time, but they aren't advised to customers and really should be when bookings are made. Our objective in going to Disneyland Paris was to give the boys a 'taster' of what Florida might have to offer in 2 or 3 years time. WE WERE NOT IMPRESSED. In Florida, Disney staff are bright and happy and always have a smile and are happy to talk to their customers. Their French counterparts are the exact opposite. (Snow White doesn't need 'Grumpy'   the miserable old git is everywhere) In Florida all litter disappears almost before it hits the floor, not so in France........it can collect in piles. There ARE cleaning staff, but they don't appear to be bothered. Shrubbery in Florida is neatly clipped and well looked after. In France some of the shrubbery is fighting a losing battle with weeds. For the adults in our party, Disneyland Paris was a huge let down, for the boys it was an exciting change   BUT, they are not aware that they missed out on so much. Their heights would have allowed them to go on most of the closed rides and we'd checked this out before we went..............any advisee about this before we went? Non, Non, Non.

So on our way to a French holiday with relatives, we booked 2 nights (at the Vienna Magic Circus which was fab but different review) and a 1 day 2 park pass. Our boys (6 and 4) first visit we were so excited and we had a loose plan of what we wanted to do especially with height restrictions. Few days before noticed a lot was closed like Peter Pan and Space Mountain, disappointed but already booked so not much we could do and we had never been before so didn't realise how bad this would be until there. We hit the Studio park first and the rides that were open like Ratatouille waited 55mins with a 4yr old already doing so well but hadn't even got on and were evacuated off as it had broken down. Went straight to Crush Coaster and after 20mins same thing happened it broken down. We headed to Toy Story Parachute and Hollywood Tower but there were over 90mins waits because there was nothing else running so everyone was hitting them. Advertised as a midi day (a May Friday not in school hols) but couldn't see how they could have got ANY more people in the parks and it was 25C so even getting a bottle of water was a mission and more queing. We went over to the Disney park hoping to at least see some characters but unlike my friend said a few months ago they are not walking about anymore it's a ... You guessed it, Que system at least 55mins alll day to see Mickey. So by now it's 1pm and the boys have done NOTHING, except que but been on no rides or seen any characters! My 6yr old just broke down I actually have a video of him saying  Disneyland isn't as fun as I thought  it was heartbreaking. We ended up going on 3 small rides like Small world and the Tea cups (can pay   1.50 at our local fun fayre to do) and watched the parade but all we did the whole day was que in boiling sun and ply the kids out of guilt with ice creams, treats and hot dogs (4 plain hot dogs, 2 bottles of water and a Coke 41E and a 30mins wait!!) more money in Disney's pocket though as you're trapped... very clever. We were told it was open until 10pm so after the parade Bee lined for the studio again to try Ratatouille but that park closes at 6pm!! No one mentioned this. I had tried to get fast passes but all gone and we spoke to a few who had got them for Ratatouille but they couldn't use them as it was broken down anyway, I did complain as we left but they didn't want to know. We gave up then, boys could barley speak from exhaustion and they had spied Planet Hollywood in the village which we then bigged up as  Pizza planet  from Toy story as they didn't get to see Buzz and Woody as hoped. Again 35min wait for a table then over an hour for our food, even the waiter was apologising. 100E for greasy pizza and a few drinks.

I had the experience of the Walt Disney World in Orlando but was curious to know how much this one could compare to the one in the States.We were quite unlucky as most attractions where close either due to maintenance or because of technical failures or even because the attractions were  on tour  the Space mountain with Aerosmith, something that I was really looking forward on doing.Being Ratatouille one of the most acclaimed one, we decided that it was worth spending 50 minutes waiting   as per the sign   an hour went by and we barely moved in the que, after a short while they announced technical failure and that were doing their best effort to solve it. After 2 hours, we were almost reaching the entrance, but just most people gave up on waiting as the technical failure announcement could still be heard. We gave up after a short while with one of the hostesses saying that they couldn't solve it and to come back later   we had already spent more than 2 hours queuing.We decided to go back to the park and pop over the Haunted House, got in in about 10 minutes and once in the carriage, after moving a couple of metres, the carriages stopped and the lights were off for about 15, until they turned the lights on while we were locked in our carriages.After what must have been almost half an hour, we were released and evacuated from the attraction as it wasn't running due to... drum roll, technical failure...We decided to head back to Indiana Jones, which we had previously skipped, and we couldn't even get trough, there were 4 ladies, dressed up as Indiana, telling people to turn around as the attraction was closed due to... guess what? Yup, you got it... technical issues!I totally understand that attractions must be kept in their best conditions to assure safety and that people enjoy the most out of it and that sometimes they have to be closed for that but I can't understand how Disney still charges full price with more than 50% of the park available to visit.

I had been to Disneyland Paris with my family 15 years earlier and remembered that we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Unfortunately Euro Disney's financial troubles these past few years were clearly visible.Let's talk rides and attractions first:Disney Studios seemed the better kept park of the two, although the majority of the rides here also needed some serious TLC! The Flying Carpets and the Cars Rallye rides hadn't apparently seen a drop of paint in years! Disneyland, especially Fantasyland, was incredibly worse for wear. The Mad Hatter's Tea Cups, Alice's Curious Labyrinth and Lancelot's Carrousel were especially badly kept. Some of the other rides at Disneyland Park even seemed to need special maintenance as there were quite a few moments where the ride would just stop mid action and then would start again a few moments later. This even happened 3 or 4 times at the Phantom Manor and the Pirates of the Caribbean rides. This is especially disappointing when you've queued for 45 minutes minimum! And believe me, this wasn't part of the act.2016 clearly isn't a good time to visit, due to refurbishments done for the 25th anniversary in 2017.The majority of Frontierland was closed for refurbishments, so was Adventureland. Which rides are being worked on and when can be easily found on the DLP website! The ride not to be missed and actually worth the wait was the brand spanking new 3D Ratatouille ride at Walt Disney Studios! Overall, the rides that were quite well executed were Crush's Coaster, Tower of Terror and Space Mountain in Discoveryland.Food, Drink and Accommodation:Ofcourse, Disneyland is incredibly expensive overall and so is the food! We booked a half board package and stayed at the Disney Santa Fe Hotel. Santa Fe is one of the cheapest of the Disney Hotels. Staff are friendly, helpful and pretty much all speak multiple languages. Our Beds at Santa Fe were comfortable and clean. Our shower had really low water pressure and could use some sprucing up.Don't bother with breakfast, unless you want to queue for 30 mins for stale croissants and frozen pain au chocolats. The continental breakfast at Santa Fe is one of the worst breakfasts I've had. At reception upon check in after 3pm, we were given our meal vouchers and were made to book our Restaurants in advance   we were pretty much put on the spot as we had no clue which restaurant served what and were kind of just told what to book by the member of staff serving us. The standard half board option offers buffet meals at a few buffet restaurants in the Hotels, at Disney Village or at the two Parks. Dinner was ok. The choice of dishes at all Restaurants was plentiful and you always have options for a starter, main and dessert. One soft drink per person was included! Buffalo Bill's Tex Mex fair at the Disney Village was nothing special. I would recommend going for the Plaza Gardens Buffet. Food here was better seasoned and offered an array of French classics.  The value of our meal voucher was    56 for two people. You could also use your voucher in one of the other Disney restaurants, I think, and just use it's cash value towards your meal. The half board offer also included a  Pause Gourmande  per person   an afternoon treat and a hot or cold drink. Go for the donut. It's really delicious! All in all we were really disappointed in our trip. If you can, save up for a real trip to Disney World Orlando and skip Disneyland Paris.

Additionally, if you want your children to get a large dose of second hand smoke take them to Disneyland Paris.The only positive thing about Disneyland Paris is they sell alcohol in the park. You do have to buy food with it so expect to buy a round of beers with a single donut. Additionally, it was nice that the train goes straight to Disneyland from Paris.

Had we had to queue long for them, we would have been extremely upset. Don't expect lots of Disney characters to be wandering round greeting you, the queue to see Mickey was over an hour!

Firstly we picked the wrong week. You would think that booking in May June you would have had some decent weather but no 3 days of heavy rain with the occasional thunderstorm nothing Disney could have done about that really but what was annoying is the profit they must have made on the sales of poncho rain coats at 10 euros a throw. Nearly everyone had to buy one as the weather was so bad. The most annoying thing was on our arrival 19 of the 45 attractions were closed for refurbishment. This included Star tours our favourite ride in Orlando , big Thunder mountain , the dragon ride , autopia, adventure island , Aladdin, Peter Pan,pirate beach Pocahontas village,rock and roll coaster to name a few. It just felt like everything good was closed. Why oh why could they have not planned this better and just had 1 or maybe 2 attractions closed at a time.

We have never done Disney before, so were not sure where to stay or what to expect. Very disappointed, I'll try and be as informative as I can, without ranting or going on. Sequoia Lodge Montana Lake View, 4134 was quiet and clean, but very basic. The 'continental' breakfast only offers children's cereals, bread and pastry, processed meat and cheese. Nothing with any protein in it. We sacked breakfast in search of some eggs ! If you want eggs or something hot you need to upgrade. Sequoia wasn't our cup of tea, we should have spent a bit more money and tried one of the better options, but you don't come here for the hotel, do you !Which leads me on !!!Again   first time here, so not sure what to expect !15 rides closed for 'maintenance'. Really !!!!Basically you may spend 5 days walking from Space Mountain to Indiana Jones. (One of which closes next week !!) If you have a child who likes thrills and not fluffy princesses. The shows are outstanding. We saw The Lighting McQueen Stunt Show twice. Buffalo Bill Wild West show, The Parades and the characters. Top quality with clearly talented individuals taking part. Birthday dinner at Cafe Mickey. Usual food choices but very pleased with time spent with Daughter by Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto. Well run by their 'Manager' !!The few rides that were open were amazing. Top quality and well run. If you like your food choices to consist of saturated fat, salt, sugars and carb loaded   then you're in for a treat! If you want healthy then you may well have to try the one or two restaurants in the Village that sell a salad. After an hour of queuing, of course! We had a lovely meal, that wasn't deep fried, at the steakhouse on our first night. We tried to return on our last night to a 2.5hr wait!! Joke!! The park was half empty as it had been chucking it down all day! On the plus side   it rained, and rained and rained. Which meant that, when the working rides weren't closed for fear of lightning strikes (or whatever)   there were hardly any queues. So we didn't need our Fast Passes   which only appear to be valid as and when the park chooses !!!Beat the queues by using the single rider option. Most of the time you get with a chum anyway and the wait is a fraction of the alternative. If you stay at one of the Park hotels, you get early access from 0800. They omit to inform you that it's only a small part that is actually open. Most of it ain't!!Again, not sure if regular users would beg to differ on that. But it was our perception. By the way ! If you want a gluten free (don't judge !!) menu at Buffalo Bills Show, think again. The option is worse that baby food. The children's chicken and potatoes would have been perfect instead of the aeroplane slop they gave my wife! Planet Hollywood offered a superb gluten free menu though. But after an hour and a half wait to be seated and served   we sacked it ! Ok, so maybe I ranted a bit and did 'go on' but I expect more from the Disney Brand. Please don't judge us.

Therefore, I thought going while I was in Europe would be cool, and I made the sacrifice, on my study abroad budget, to pay for the tickets. Imagine my excitement when I found out the tickets were two parks for the price of one on the day I was planning on going. I checked the website 10 times (not an exaggeration) to make sure that the information I found was correct. I proceeded to purchase the tickets, but the website would not allow me to add the tickets to the cart. It kept redirecting me to new pages until I finally clicked the option and it added the tickets. Cool trick because it was the wrong ticket selection. For the same price as the two for one deal, Disney offered admittance to only one park. That was what I ended up buying and using in Paris. We went to the Studios first because it was smaller and then never got into Disneyland Park. I went to customer service for help, and they did not live up to the Disney standard. He said he knew there was an option for two parks for the price of one, and yes, it was exactly the same price, but since I put the wrong one in my basket, his manager said there was nothing to be done about it. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN BE LOSING MONEY. I wasn't asking for free admittance. I just wanted the ticket that I was not allowed to purchase a few days before.

So we are used to the quality and standards Disney usual sets. Unfortunately, Disneyland Paris falls short in nearly every area. Pros:  Disneyland Paris has the prettiest castle and it has a dragon under it.  Discoveryland (their version of Tomorrowland) is very well themed and unique, the details and care taken in this area are obvious and it is the highlight of the park.  The Ratatouille area in Disney Studios is another fantastic space, and the Ratatouille ride is exceptionally well done.Cons:  Most of the rides are much better at other parks. Pirates and Phantom Manor (Haunted Mansion), for example, both have obvious bare ceilings. If you've ever ridden Pirates in California, you know that the ceilings are part of the show, with wafting clouds, creating an amazing illusion of space. This may seem trivial, but when you've seen Disney imagineering at its best, it's hard not to see it as lazy at Disneyland Paris, because it's nearly ever ride that seems like they've taken short cuts or just couldn't be bothered.  Restaurants and shops close early (or don't open at all), depending on the day. This is something I have never seen at any other Disney park.   Cast Members are no where near as friendly or as effective. Our last trip we saw open drug use, with cast members not bothering to do anything. We also saw a man pee against a wall. Not exactly family friendly... This is in addition to the constant smoking, which is just par for the course   be warned.  Maintenance is another huge issue, as the parks very desperately need some TLC. From things constantly breaking, to graffiti, to much needed updates, Disney really needs to address things.

Most of the people in these queues were adults or much older children, who are waiting for rides that are probably intended for younger children.Also, many of the children   s play areas were also closed and two of the stations were closed, which doesn   t help.We stayed for 4 nights (3 days in the park) and apart from watching the parade, and one show, it was a complete waste of time and money.

Not when you consider that among these 10 were things like the Carrousel and Tea Cups, you might want to consider visiting your local fun fair or UK theme parks. Especially when you add your transport, hotel and food expenses, it presents the prospect of going to Disneyland Paris in a very negative light.We had a VIP Fastpass from a previous visit which they issue to guests that stay in their swanky suites, thinking that we could use it this time. However, they no longer issue or honor these, so it seems that there is very little incentive to spend any money with them on accommodation either. Fortunately, we stayed at a better hotel (and there are plenty nearby) off site for far less!And when I'd asked their representatives at the information centre (City Hall) as to why there were so many closures, they were well rehearsed in objection handling stating text book responses that they are getting ready for the summer and their 25th anniversary, that rides were getting tired and that closures were published on their website etc ... So what about us then? In light of these closures, why were we charged MAGIC rates (which is not the cheapest tariff)? It seems that Disneyland are still hell bent on cashing in on the hard earned cash of working families who can only travel during school holidays! I hope that in writing this long (and perhaps rambling) review that some of you may think twice as to whether you want to visit, and if you do when you plan to visit the theme park.If you still do, a few tips:1. Save yourself some money and stay at at a hotel or serviced apartment off site. You can always prepare a picnic and return back to the car park (where there is a picnic area nearby) for lunch   dinner.2. Plan ahead by checking their website for closures and devise an itinerary accordingly. Otherwise, you'll end up walking around aimlessly and queuing unnecessarily (as we did this time). 3. Get yourself a Fastpass as early as possible to cut down your queuing time later. You can only secure one Fastpass at any one time (this was not the case before) but if you get an early return time, you may be able to get another for a different attraction before they are fully allocated for the day. The newer attractions like Ratatouille are always very popular.4. Make sure you don't miss the Parade (5.30 pm last week) and stick around for the light show   firework display when the park closes (10 pm).",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Both of the rides which can be ridden by smaller children are closed, AT THE SAME TIME. The mind boggles. I found it particularly galling that Space Mountain, which my child has ridden many times at HK Disneyland (a great park though very busy) requires 132cm in Paris but only 120cm in HK.

681,362216752,1,2016-4,United Kingdom,I recently spent 4 days at both Disney Parks with 3 children and we also stayed in a Disney Hotel (Davy Crockett Ranch) so I feel justified in writing a review. The experience was quite simply atrocious. I mean absolutely abysmal. I build product teams for a living and if I had been involved in putting out such a sub par product I would be ashamed. Here is a brief list of the problems   1. Rides that were closed Aerosmith roller coaster closed Animagique closed Star Wars ride closed Thunder Mountain closed Big Mesa Waterboat closed Peter Pan Ride closed Pirate Island playground closed Pocahontas playground Future land train station closed Swiss Family Robinson closed Andy RC racer closed Pizza Planet closed Agrabah cafe closed Horse Drawn a arrives closed Main Street train closedFuete Restaurant Closed2. Rides that broke down Disney Juniors broke down 30 seconds before the start...literally 30 seconds with no apology and nearly 100 crying kids who had waited for upwards of an hour Ratatouille ride broke down after 40 minute wait Slinky roller coaster closed early at 4pm Magic carpets fast pass machine out of order Monsters Inc scream o meter out of order Magic Carpet ride   three of the carpets malfunctioned and refused to rise; parents had to complain 80 minute wait for Nemo roller coaster and no fast pass available 3. Issues with meals   eating Restaurant booking system broke down across the park on Tues 5th meaning could not make reservations to use meal tickets Restaurant reservations were only taken in person in the restaurant....genius idea except Davy Crockett ranch is 5 miles from the park... The team time snack for Disney Studios is redeemable in only one restaurant which had counters closed during the peak period of 3 6 with an average 20 minute wait Under 3's eat free...except at Davy Crockett Ranch where under 3's are given Apple pur  e for the duration of the holiday. Saw a customer being refused to trade his baguette for a packet of cornflakes No cornflakes available on third day 4. General criticisms There are more merchandise shops open than rides   that is unacceptable Every restaurant is used a way to sell merchandise which generates awful queues The kids area of Disney Studios (Playland) is 1 3 of the size of the adults area with tight lanes and steps whilst the adults area (Armageddon) is wide boulevards. Who thought that up?! No characters to greet people on entry or exit to the park over any of the four days. Seriously? I mean not one character to greet guests? Walked around both parks for 4 days and we saw two characters   Pluto and Marie from Aristocats. That is simply unacceptable. Summary Without doubt one of the worst experiences of a theme park I have ever had. Basically; 3 children spent four days looking for mockery mouse and the only place they saw him was on the merchandise you ram down customers throats after the rides break down.

The fast track system, much like other parks, is an excellent idea. However because of the park being at over capacity, the fast track points were closed by 11.00am as they were all used up.

We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge hotel, our first room had a flooded carpet from next door's shower so we were 'upgraded' to another room (a Montana) which was exactly the same in every way apart from being in the main hotel as opposed to a separate block. The decor of the rooms is very tired, even my children (10 & 12) both commented that it was horrible. No kettle or tea & coffee making facilities in the the room. The towels provided for the shower were literally as small as hand towels.Being Easter hols I had hoped that more of the rides would have been open but a huge number were closed for refurbishment which was yet another disappointment. Many of the shows we did go to featured an awful lot of filler and about 2 minutes of any interest.What really left a bad taste in my mouth was the ridiculous cost of the restaurants, for the three of us to have anything other than a burger hotdog cheap pizza would have left me at least    100 lighter per meal. One of the restaurants on site was charging    31 for a BURGER! At another I was charged    32 for three rolls and 3 cans of drink.

The queue for The pirates of the carribean ride was interesting enough to make the hour wait fly by. This can't be said for the star wars ride or space mountain. The hour or so wait each time was dull. And when we wanted to eat there just was not enough choice.

I wonder if next years 25th anniversary is the focus for all the current ride closures now, as the Park tries to 're launch' itself with ride upgrades. The result, whatever the reason, is an unacceptable number of ride closures on our visit with more to come (just check the DLP ride closure list its a long one!). There is only Haunted mansion open in Frontier land, and all other lands have closures along with the entire Railroad. The entrance to the Park is a building site too. Such a shame because it feels like the heart is missing from the place. The price to get in is really not worth the experience and food, drink and merchandise is a disgraceful price. Kids just don't want to know that things are really expensive, Disney know this and we just have to lump the extortion.

I can only assume the people who rate this place highly are adults who believe the tooth fairy and Santa really do exist and don't mind being taken for a ride (the pun being that you wont be on many rides during the day due to spectacularly long queues). I think you can identify these people quite easily as they are wearing Mickey ears.If, like me, you want reasonable entertainment for you 74 bucks then you will be duly disappointed. Seriously disappointed. Angrily disappointed. Agreed, going over the NY period was a little short sighted but I would have thought a established park would cater for this. No, it was just an opportunity for Disney to pack in as many unsuspecting fools (us) and loony bin escapees (ear clad folk).Some points of note:  Queues for rides: The main rides had queues of around 1 1 2 hours. As we have 3 kids under the age of 8 we cant stand in queues that long. Other, lesser, rides were between 40 mins and an hour, which we contended with but the rides are the mediocre type you can pay 4 quid for when the travelling folk come to your local town.  The rides: The rides themselves are nothing to write home about. Nothing at all like EuropaPark, Alton Towers or parks in the US (non Disney). We liked the hotel elevator ride but that was about all that was unique and worth returning to. Quite a few rides were out for maintenance and 2 rides broke whilst we were queuing or on them (  Fastpass: Total joke. Do not be fooled into thinking this makes you day any easier. For example, we took a FP for a ride at 10am. The time given was 12.30pm. You cant take another FP until after 12.30pm. When we had finished the ride, the FP time for another ride was 5pm. The following day, we took a pass as 10.30am and it was not until 4pm that we could use it. After this, no more passes were available as there was not enough time in the day.  Food: Think of a thoroughly awful burger van that costs 15 quid for a meal then you can set your expectations.  New Years Eve: The parade was nice (if you could see it) but the main park so crowded at midnight you couldn't walk down the main street. It was utterly packed, I haven't seen so many people in such a tight place ever. I was worried for our safety. That plus the hours before midnight looked like the Jungle in Calais with bodies of tired, miserable people waiting for midnight, full of non nutritional carbs and sugar, black ears drooping.DNP is making a loss, it has been since it opened in 1992. The knock on effect is less money spent on the park and a worsening experience for visitors. My family visited in the year it opened and said lots of effort was made to entertain people in the queues, the place was smart and food ok.

Having just got back from a 4 night visit I am not in my normal rush to book again mood, I'm in a not sure I ever want to go back mood. Yes I know it was half term week so it was going to be a little more busy, however it wasn't as busy as I expected, yet I still found myself in 2 hour lines waiting for rides or meet and greets. This was due to some cleaver person deciding that too many attractions were in need of TLC and rather than close one at a time they decided to do all of those attractions needing tlc at the same time. Years of under investment has more than likely forced this on the powers that be at Disney, however other attractions or extra meet and greats should have been offered to make up for these attractions. This would have reduced wait times for everything, leaving more happiness rather than stressed out, cold grumpy families and I'm not just talking about my family. Everyone was moaning about the same thing and it really did take the magic away from the place. Can I also add grumpy cast members and even characters who really didn't seem interested or bothered. The lack of characters around the park did not make things any better and those that were doing meet and greets the lines were very very long, as after all isn't that why most people go to Disney. I'm sure my little girl wasn't the only girl who was left disappointed by the lack of princesses to meet and no frozen anything anywhere apart from one float on the much shorter than usual parade. I feel for the money that me and everyone else spent last week to visit, it really was not worth it and I feel like my money should have been better spent elsewhere.. There were a few high points mainly how good the girl who was Aurora was with my little one, however let down by the 2 hour wait for her.

However it is our opinion that the system changes introduced since our first visit 16yrs ago would appear to be designed to ensure that disabled guests, especially those with motobility problems queue aslong as, if not longer than everyone else! In addition 'parent swaps' now have to wait outside attractions, effectively separating families, in our experience for upto an hour per ride! Without going into too much detail my Sons disabilities are obvious and are mental aswell as physical and yet he was left for over an hour in ratatouille, with his Dad, whilst others went on before him because no one could be bothered to explain that the wheelchair car had broken down! As with other rides my husband would've just lifted him on if this had been explained. On the small world ride we could've just gone into the main queue as there was no wait time but in the disabled queue we were told, quite rudely, that we'd have to come back. We weren't allowed on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at all! The cast member cited H& S reasons, it was busy but then promptly allowed a group of 4, 20 something couples on, no obvious signs of disability and all mobile, (don't want to get into an issue regards hidden disabilities, it's just an observation). A British family followed with a green card but no mobility issues and were promptly allowed to ride too, they'd no prescheduled time booked either. Imagine trying to explain to an excited 21yr old, with both mental and physical there to celebrate his birthday that even though we are inside the attraction he wasn't allowed on. Did I mention that one of the 20 something's, incited by the cast member informing them I wasn't happy they were taking my sons place on the ride, spat at me? No? What an experience at 'Where dreams are made'!Have to say, in balance, that certain cast members used common sense and especially on the Tower of Terror, Indian Jones and Rockin roller coaster it was a pleasarable experience but not enough to balance the scale considering our reasons for being there.We stayed in Davy Crocket ranch and the cabins and pool were nice and we found the standard half board good value for money especially during half term.I'm not sure whether this will make any difference and I called into City Hall on our way out to make a firmly complaint but nevertheless it is worth warning others that bring given a 'green card' doesn't always mean that the vulnerable and needy will be offered the treatment they deserve.

At 32 euros for an adult and 17 for a child, this seemed expensive but then that's typical throughout Disney Parks . . . oh and 5 euros for a can of coke   fanta is ridiculously overpriced (the adult meals do not include drinks !)Onto the parks . . . the days we visited it seemed the 'extra magic hours' were pointless   Space Mountain didn't open until 9, Big Thunder Mountain was shut so there was little value in the extra hour whatsoever ! MGM Studios faired even worse   we spent 1.5 hours queuing for Crush's coaster to then be told that there was a fault on the ride . . . off we trudged to the Studio Tour where we waited for 60 minutes to be told that there was a fault with the main attraction and therefore the ride had to close. To experience one disappointment after waiting for so long is bad, but to experience 2 is unacceptable, especially when you have 2 young children who have waited patiently   it's these little people who remember most, and we left the park at 11am as crowds were ridiculously busy and ride wait times were a minimum of 100 minutes . . . so, having spent the best part of 350 Euros for the days tickets, all we had was 2.5 hours of waiting in queues to show for it   not great value for money !!!!We left Paris vowing to never return and the children left deeply disappointed and upset that they could not enjoy what should have been a fun vacation   their lasting memory will be that they could never achieve the fun which they had set out to experience . . . as adults, our lasting memory will be that brand Disney is falling way short of the expectations it should be setting itself, and we saw a side which is glaringly apparent that the company is reaping huge amounts of profits, on overpriced goods without the necessary re investment.We will NEVER return",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I can honestly say I simply do not get all the hype and the myth of the Disney Magic, if you enjoy getting completely ripped off, queuing for hour and hours for 1 minute rides and looking around hundreds of merchandise shops then this is the place to go. The parks are way over crowded, the only way to describe it is if you when to a premier league football match with a pram and tried to walk around the stadium it is absolutely chocked you cannot move. The ques are just ridiculous with times ranging from 40 mins to 2 hours, the wait time for food and drink in fast food places is 20   30 minutes min and the only time we never waited in a que was when buying Disney stuff for the kids, as there are so many shops selling the same same same same things you never have to wait. My 4 and 7 year olds did have a nice time when we got on rides but to be honest they have had better times at Alton Towers and Lego land where there are far more rides and attraction to see than in Disney and it does not cost me a small fortune. The cost of food and drinks is shocking and something I cannot see how Dsney can justify but everyone is there and you just have to take the big hit in the pocket. 4 hot dogs, 4 small hot chocolates and a water    43 euro. Meals for 4 will set you back    150 euro for bog standard food it's a rip off. If I can avoid it I will not return, my advise is find another theme park somewhere else in the UK or Europe and you will have a better time and not get robbed by the money making global corporation.

By the time we were INSIDE the park que times on rides were already 1 hour . We had a turn on the merry go round which lasted just over 1 minute ... Next we tried dumbo but a 90 minute waiting time deterred us so we headed for the thunder mountain . A roller coaster my 2 kids can ride and had been looking forward too ..CLOSED in fact apart from the frozen sing along the entire area around thunder mountain was being refurbished and was closed or under scaffolding .My wife and daughter then had to que 15 minutes to go to the toilet !!! Unbelievable ! We decided that we would have a bite to eat then try for buzz light year . Ok I expect to wait for food but yet again que sizes and lack of seating spaces meant we were unable to actually sit down to a table in the three restaurants we tried first . Eventually ending up with a sand which . The kids were becoming a little annoyed now having realized that today was going to be a bit rubbish in my six year old girls opinion . So I took her to see the parade the frozen characters came past in a coach too quickly past imo ... Followed a sort time later by the Disney Dream parade ... Again a few floats went past , admittedly the costumes and staff playing the parts were superb so I thought but it was so difficult to see anything . All the space is taken up with fenced off gradens and concession stands selling the same over priced goods all over the place . And there just seemed to be too many people . My kids were hungry and I needed a coffee so we headed for adventure land where there is more for the smaller ones . Again the toilet que for the ladies were incredible and on entering the men's found the ladies were queuing in there as well !! My wife waited 35 minutes at a cafe   refreshment stand manned by one person there was never less than 20 people in the que at a time and when my wife arrived next to the front he said he was closing !we managed to get 2 very good toffee apples though and a coffee . Thanks ...Next stop then fast pass tickets for buzz light year ride my seven year old boy having been 2 cm to short for space mountain and thunder mountain being closed really wanted the buzz light year ride .. It's getting on for 3.30 pm now and we have basically been queuing from 8 am ... Our shuttle bus had broken down on the way to the park .... No problem for fast pass tickets ... For 21.15 pm hahaha! The que was again at 90 minute mark so we headed for toy land and slinky roller coaster . 40 minute wait for a forty second ride . If it had been a roller coaster no problems but this ride just went round in bumpy circles .. 4 times .... My six year old girl had , had enough ... We headed for Disney studios where it was the same scenario ... 95 minute wait for turtle roller coaster . 45 minute wait for magic carpet . So time was up we were hungry and a little cold so we headed back to our hotel and returned in the evening for the show and buzz light year ride which we had fast pass for . The buzz ride is not to be missed and IF you can stand with your kids on your shoulders for twenty mins or so the closing show is incredible tbh . So over all our experience was a disappointment and one we will not Ever repeat again The only magic in Disney land is how fast your wallet empty s The end .",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The thing they don't advertise is that if you go to the town hall they give you a disabled badge so you can skip the queues. This was a life saver BUT we were only lucky to get the info to obtain it on the second day by chance.My main issue is that they CHARGE to use a stroller or wheel chair! Never known anyone do this for a disabled child. This is morally wrong and the park needs to sort this out! Oh not only is it    15 per day but if you want to take it to your hotel you have to fork out a further    50 deposit. Plus every single time you take it past the gate you have to produce the letter...a nightmare when you have 4 children to hold onto. The toilets on the 3rd day in the park were disgusting.

You get better rides on Great Yarmouth seafront and without having to queue for an hour. The whole park is a little shabby, it is intensley overcrowded. We have been saving our Eurodisney trip for a time when our children could remember it well as it is such an expensive day out, but we would have been better staying in England and going to the seafront.I was well planned, I'd checked all the  rides  and picked out the ones that suited our family, I even researched the  restaurants  so I knew where the options were to eat. Everyone warns about the queues so I didn't want to waste time wondering where to eat or which ride to go on next. On the website there are beautiful, prettily lit pictures talking about Bavarian and African themed restaurants. What they don't tell you is that they are basically just McDonalds Fast food joints with a kebab for the African theme, or a pretzel for the Bavarian. I can see why they do it with such an excessive amount of people coming through the doors, it is probably the best quickest way to serve food, but it is grossly over advertised. My children were so excited to eat in a Lion King inspired restaurant and were disappointed that they were basically in a McDonalds painted in sand colours with a couple of pictures of Pumba and Timon.Similar story with the rides. On the website they talk about a magical ride, an exciting adventure. The best ones were the things you could wander through, like the Sleeping Beauty castle or the Alladdin's cave. But really paying that price so you can wander through a couple of rooms with pictures of the films on them?And waiting over half an hour for a very substandard ghost train (Snow white and the seven dwarves) or a little cart that takes you through scenes from Pinocchio (if you've been to Cadbury World, it isn't as good as the chocobean ride which is silly and cheesy, but a bit of fun, no queue and you get chocolate at the end!) There is a great cart ride in Blackpool Pleasure Beach and you don't have to save up for months to go on it.Getting there was also a hassle, we bought a Eurostar ticket, confidently proclaiming quick and easy access to the park. We (and many more families) were given a ticket with a changeover in Lille of 30 minutes, we were given the option of choosing our seat numbers, which we did, only to find when we finally got to the station because we'd changed the seats we weren't able to go through and someone else had been given our seat s and we were issued with other (separating both me and my husband from our two children   luckily a woman swapped seats with me so I could be near the girls, but she didn't have to). There were a number of families who were rushed and hassled, and though we all got onto the train intact, it was not a great way to end the trip, and as a lasting impression of the day a very sad end for the children.Well done to the hardworking sad, shame on you those grabbing the money hand over fist for such a substandard attraction.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

774,313886482,2,2015-9,United States,"I found that I had an extra day in Paris so I decided to go to Disneyland. The train system makes it very easy to get to the park and I highly recommend taking the train to get to the park. However, I must say, my visit was very disappointing. The bathrooms were very dirty. They smelled of urine and gave the impression you were in a run down gas station. There were cigarette butts all over the grounds and there was trash floating in most of the water features. While some of the staff were pleasant and helpful, I found that most of the employees had an attitude that the guests were an annoyance. This was especially true in the food court areas. The park was very inefficient. The food court lines took forever and many rides were sent out with empty seats, time and time again, even though there were guest in line to ride the ride. It just didn't make sense to me. This place had the feel of a bad six flags park rather than a Disney park. It was a real shame. I will say I visited in Sept. and this is their  off season . So, maybe there was a staffing issue. With that said, the weather was great and there were hardly any lines. So, if you do go, I would recommend going in Sept. I also found that the Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean rides were much more up to date and all around better than the ones in Los Angeles. Certainly, if you go, make sure to see these attractions. One of the more curious disappointments was many of the attractions were closed. ie. Indiana Jones roller coaster and the Crush roller coaster in the Disney Studio parks, as well as others. The park had an overall feeling that it was on the verge of going out of business. Again, it may be that Sept. is a slower time and maybe a high time to do repairs? I was fun to hear the familiar Disney songs in French. And, as always, it was great to see kids and their families of all backgrounds, races, religions, etc. all getting along together and having fun together. However, I certainly would not waste my money at this park. I would recommend you go to Orlando, FL. or Los Angeles Disney, instead. Bottom Line....

775,313833555,1,2015-9,Australia,"Where to start? Why is Disney allowing this dreadful park to ruin it's great name? We, as a family of four, stayed on site to benefit from the extra hours. First mistake. The Cheyenne is dreadful. Awful breakfast, no in room Wifi (unless you pay 15 Euro per night) and a cleaning lady who repeatedly bashed at the door and yelled to me when she couldn't get into my room to clean it (I was sick, and had latched and locked the door). That would have been great if we had a sleeping baby How much does it cost to provide a 'do not disturb' sign???The parks are supposedly no smoking, except for designated smoking areas. if only, and I smoke! People were smoking EVERWHERE, next to kids, even whilst talking to Disney staff, yet nothing was done. Ditto selfie sticks. There are signs stating that they are banned in the parks, yet people were routinely allowed in by Disney staff with them.The waiting times were ridiculous, with the staff seeming to have no idea how to move people quickly through rides. Nowhere was this more evident than on the Autopia ride. The queues were huge due to the ineptitude of the staff to organise people in and out of cars efficiently.The extra hours if you stay on site, are in the morning, between 8 and 10. Stupid idea. Firstly it means that kids have to get up early for breakfast, then to go to the park. After a hectic day prior, they are already exhausted. To exacerbate matters, the extra hours only apply to one park, and most of the rides remain closed until 10!!!! What the? They would be much better off adopting the US model where the extra hours apply in various parks, and in the evening.Food prices. Oh my. We had been warned, but were still shocked. To make it worse, there is a private shop at the train station where you can buy various food items. Their smoothie costs the same as water in the parks. Their muffins, at 2.3 euros compare well with Disney's smaller ones at 4.99 euros. 30 euros for a steak sandwich??? 9 Euros for a milkshake? Who are they kidding? These are not Michelin star restaurants!Does the fact that no one can move in McDonalds at park closing time not tell them anything? Interestingly, we walked past Pomme de Pain on the Champs Elysees, prime real estate, and even THEY were cheaper than Disney.Too many rides were breaking down (Buzz Lightyear stopped 3 or 4 times per ride).This place needs a complete overhaul, from management down.We have been to Disneyworld several times.

The Disney staff were just as scarce, apart from those that manned the retail outlets, which appeared to be the overriding aim.... get as much money out of the visitors as possible. Every ride had at least an hours wait, unless of course you paid the extra for the Fast Track. Vending stalls took 20 minutes to serve you. How long can it take to sell someone a fizzy drink? The same to buy a balloon, yet another 20 minute queue. We tried to take the train that runs around the perimeter of the park. We joined yet another queue to see a half filled train leave the station so we gave up on that as well.

Staff universally (in our experience) pleasant and happy to help not to mention honest (I dropped a    120 fitness tracker in Phantom, Manor and was amazed that a staff member had found it and handed it in). Positives were a wealth of catering outlets, lots of seating, access for 'larger persons' and an outstanding fireworks and light show (albeit at 11pm). Major negative (and this is a really big one) was the lack of Disney Characters   in five days only saw Pooh, Mickey, Minnie and Goofy outside the parade........ compared with Florida that is dreadful   the overall Disney obsession with Frozen was also a little too dominant.

We came in August in the height of the school holidays, so crowds and queuing were to be expected, but not on this scale: quite simply the park feels way too full. Whe we booked, we were told we'd need a few days to do it properly but I assumed that was because there was so much to see, not because you'd only get a few rides in a day! At times, you literally felt like you were in a rugby scrum just walking along Main Street and I was constantly worried we'd lose one of the children. Ride times were on average 90 minutes and the fast track system is annoying as you'd end up with a ticket for two hours from now, and by that time the kids were tired and we'd be on the way back to the hotel. The restaurants also had insane queues, staff felt frazzled and demotivated. We went into an ice cream parlour and a very harnessed member of staff said her colleague would be out in five minutes. The boys spent the time choosing what flavour and toppings they wanted, just to be told it wouldn't in fact open for another half hour....cue tears and upset.On a positive note, the rides themselves (when you get on them) are fabulous and the Disney Dreams show is amazing and very worth staying up for. The Lightning McQueen stunt show and the Buffalo Bills dinner were both great too. I realise any theme park is actually a massive money making business but it doesn't have to done as blatently as this. There was almost no 'surprise and delight' or little extra touches to make the magic come alive. Every single building seemed to be a restaurant or a shops do everything is geared up to fleece you for extra money. When it started raining, my husband said  come on, let's go back to the hotel. It's depressing enough even in the sunshine....!  We definitely wouldn't be back here and when we talked about talking that boys to Florida, we've agreed we'll only visit one or two theme parks out there if we go for a fortnight   and none of them will be Disney.On a final note, I've read a lot of reviews like this and notice there is zero engagement or response from Disney themselves.

807,302452901,2,2015-8,Singapore,"The frustration started with the booking process, when we simply could not get our tickets via the website. We wrote to them, and they said it was our bank which disallowed the transaction to go through. We ended up trying with credit cards from three different banks, and calling up each of the three banks, but all of them said the same thing   that it was the website that was not working. Disneyland Paris refused to accept that and continued blaming our banks.We finally got somebody staying in France to help us to purchase the three day tickets. Unfortunately for us, the frustrations did not end there.We got the feeling that they were simply trying to cram as many guests in the park as possible, to maximise revenue. They did not really care about the guest experience etc.The carpark gantry where they were collecting the car parking fees felt more like a border checkpoint, with lines stretching hundreds of metres, and waits of up to an hour   just to pay 15 euros to enter the carpark. It was more of the same at the security checkpoints (where they checked the bags of guests) and the park entrances. In the parks, queues were also very long and we spent at least 70% of our time waiting in line at the rides, eateries, shops, washrooms etc.The level of cleanliness in some areas in the park was also pretty appalling. The washrooms were almost always unclean. Tables and chairs at the eateries also commonly needed a good wipe (we saw many people doing that). There are also many corners in the park where one can definitely smell pee. Probably people had given up (or were unable to continue) waiting in line at the washrooms and just relieved themselves elsewhere.We also felt uncomfortable that people were smoking everywhere in the park, and that the only place where one could avoid having cigarette smoke blown in your face was, ironically, at the designated smoking corners. When this is supposed to be a kid friendly place, I am not sure if they might want to do something about it.We found language to be a problem in some areas in the park as well. I guess this is not totally the fault of the park operators. After all, we were in France, and it was therefore expected that there are always some people, service staff included, who only spoke French and nothing else.

Large parts of the park were closed for refurbishment despite this being one of their busiest weekends. Several rides broke down over the weekend, we were escorted off of one ride after it failed for technical reasons, not ideal when you have spent over an hour in the que with young children. We were unable to use the lockers in the park due to security issues but there was no warning of this before you entered the park. The characters are eager to leave their areas as soon as their allotted time is up leaving several children upset as they had been waiting to meet them (maybe they should stop people joining the line if the characters are about to leave?)and lastly the sheer volume of litter and overflowing bins was disappointing, the toilets were also in a terrible state, I appreciate it isn't Disneys fault how people use them but they did not appear to be checked or cleaned during the day as you would expect..

Which is  fun  if you were standing in a queue for the past 60 minutes.And of course waiting times were huge everywhere. So if you don't use a smartphone with the Disneyland Paris app, you're done for. 40 minutes estimated waiting time upon entry, soon became 1h30. Everyone wants to get on a ride obviously, but for us the whole system of fast passes needs to get re looked at. On some attractions, there were no time slots displayed for the fast passes, so anyone with a pass could get on. No matter what time slot they were allocated. And people: if you stand in line: stay there. One person holding places for 6 others to show up as soon as you are about to enter the ride... it is NOT DONE.Nor is it very polite to breathe in eachothers' neck. There is a socially accepted thing called  personal space.  I don't like it if people get so close they can check the label of my underwear.And than, there was the staff. Some very friendly, some... well, not. We've been to Florida last year and every single staff member was polite and greeted us with a smile. It costs nothing, but it makes a huge difference.Oh, and I need to mention the parades. Or the lack of. 3 years ago, in Paris, a parade was a Parade. Fun to watch, lots of actors. Now, it seemed like  hush hush, let's get this thing over with, with as few staff as possible.  For example, what was advertised as a Frozen parade was one single carriage, carrying Elsa and her sister. Cutting in staff costs because of the 120 million euro Ratatouille investment, Disneyland Paris?And finally: the area behind the Castle, was unaccesible starting from 21h15. Because of the light show. Which started at 23h00. That was cool... since we planned on visiting the shop inside the Castle to grab us some crystal souvenirs. But hey, if you don't want our money...I know this sounds like a bit of a rant. But we were disappointed. Especially since we got to see what the American equivalent of a Disney theme park looks like. Disneyland Paris is beginning to look like something of an insult.Was it all bad? No. Of course we had fun. Because fun is what you make of it. Tower of Terror is a fantastic ride and so is Big Thunder Mountain. And Buzz Lightyear's Pizza Planet Restaurant is something we can recommend: all you can eat buffet at a fair price and helpful and friendly staff.But I really don't think we will be going back anytime soon.

The customer service is mediocre at best. As an example of this my daughter had a birthday badge at California last year and all the staff said happy birthday and the entertainers sang to her (magical). This year we only got 2 happy birthdays all day and very few of the staff break into a smile for anything. There is a severe lack of characters. When I first went about 10 years ago there were Disney characters everywhere including the restaurants. I counted 3 in the whole of Hollywood studios, which doesn't even have a parade any more and the Frozen parade in the main park consisted of a single horse and carriage. The shows are nowhere near as good as the American counterparts. While the kids enjoyed the Frozen sing along the production values are basic (bring back Tarzan) and nothing like Aladdin (California) or Lion King or Belle (Florida).

So this year my husband arranged a surprise trip to Paris that included a visit to both Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park, and I was really excited. The disappointment couldn't have been bigger!The rides are boring and outdated, I think every little county fair nowadays has more exciting attractions. Also you have to stand in line for ages to get on a ride   if they're working at all, because several of them were closed for renovation. But don't think that they informed visitors ahead, you had to walk to the attraction in question to find out about that. I've been to a lot of amusement parks, but never to one that would close some of its main attractions for renovation during the main season. In the light of Eurodisney's financial troubles you don't have to be an economist to know where some of their problems are coming from...While the attractions are lacking in numbers and quality, there is definitley no lack of souvenir shops in this park. In fact my husband and I had the terrible feeling we paid admission to walk through one big  Disney cash machine . If you bring your kids you either need to have steady nerves or access to an unlimited credit card.They also offer fastpasses for some of the rides, but when we got one for  Big Thunder Mountain  it told us to return in 6 hours...We also found most the descriptions and plans of the park rather poor, we were standing in front of some of the attractions and couldn't find out what exactly to expect. The food was poor and overpriced, but then that was no surprise.To top it all we spent a whole day there without seeing one Mickey Mouse!!! I wanted to have a picture taken with one of the mascots, but we only saw one measly Winny Pooh during our whole visit, and when we approached him to have a picture taken he turned around and walked away. In order to see a Mickey Mouse they made you stand in line again and wait for ages.

However, overall we were disappointed with Disney Land Park. Having recently been to Universal Studios in Singapore, we'd had high expectations. Unfortunately the age of Disney Paris is showing and the lack of modern technology in the rides is evident. You could overlook the dated nature of the place, as they clearly can't be updating it all the time. But what we could not overlook is an overt attempt to gouge every last cent out of you. When it came to lunch time, there were no simple stalls to be seen where you could get a hot dog or a sandwich (we eventually saw one at 5pm). You are effectively forced to eat in one of their over priced restaurants. We settled for their  fine American all you can eat buffet.  For EUR30 per adult and EUR17 for a child above 3 years of age you got to eat very average food   oh and ONE glass of soft drink! For those of you with young children you will probably share the pain of even getting your children to eat (and don't think of your kids simply eating what you bring with you if you want to go in   they charge you at the door as you walk in!). This was after a poor experience on the ticketing. We booked the Mini Ticket which allows access to both Parks in Low season for a day. Unfortunately we had to postpone our trip due to an emergency and had to move it to high season. Their website tells you that you can top up if you want to use the ticket in high season. What they don't tell you is that you don't top up to the two park high season price   you have to pay much more. So be it, but it would be better if the website is a little more transparent on what it means to top up. I only found out after a few calls to their call centre in Paris   it's not shown on the site. All in all, the kids will always remember that they've been to Disneyland, but it would be good if the experience was improved as time goes on so that parents feel it is worth the price.

Space mountain mission 2 is better than Orlando. Crush's coaster is awesome and deserves a fastpass option. Ratatouille is quite good. It is really nice being able to walk between the parks and the village, making back and forth a possibility rather than losing an hr or usually more getting a bus, monorail, boat, or driving between parks in Orlando. Hands down, the evening spectacular is faaaar better than Orlando; really, Orlando, update the night show! We have been to disney world 4 times in the past three years and countless times I went as a youngster. I feel very comfortable at Disney and have a good idea about the expectations of ALL their cast members (staff). We have been to disney Paris twice. Of the four most recent times to Orlando, I can't recall one altercation with the staff, but let's just say there were a couple staff members that weren't completely perky or talkative. Now, let's bullet point DLP: 1) two years ago, we tried to buy a child's meal and they were out....out! No kids meal in the place created for children! Ok, give them a pass, it's one time, right?2) this time, we are out of chicken...no way, out of some food, again.3) we are out of ice cream...you are kidding me, right? You did look at the weather forecast of 90 degrees F and all sunshine for the week and consider that would be a popular item surely, so what happened there?4) forget about locating cold cokes. Near impossible and you must visit a few vendors or go directly to a restaurant. 5) crush's coaster was broke three times that we were aware of over four days, big thunder at least once, buzz stopped FIVE times during one ride, backlot tour down at least once, the fairy story train was broke at least once, and no water was in the pool space around dumbo nor teacups. I know things breakdown, but this felt excessive and while I was in customer services, another man was complaining to them about the broken rides and said it seemed half the park was down. 6) on the note of customer service, I had to visit them twice to lodge full complaints, like fill out a form complaints...have never once filled out a form in Orlando. Let's bullet the complaints... 1) we had read online that fantasyland closes early for the firework show. 9 pm. Ok. Got it. 8:50, marionette restaurant is out of chicken. Fine, over to cookout restaurant in another section. 9:35, we go in the doors and man has it roped off inside. Why? We are closed. But the doors are not locked. What time do you close? 10 pm. But it's only 9:35. But you won't get to the register by 10 because the line is 5 8 deep at two registers. No way! Where can we go? Only Main Street. When speaking to an English woman on the train to paris, she said she had the same issue and didn't know they closed early in other sections. Same here! Seems they could avoid a lot of these problems by posting the times of each restaurant on the map...you know, the place we all refer to when questioning things about the parks. Then be willing to serve those that enter the restaurant until it closes, and not 25 before.  2) enter backlot tour and cast member directs us down a lane. I get to the end with my 4 yr old son and there is a chain across the bars where you turn to follow rest of line. I look around confused with hands out but no member acknowledges the chain. I figure a child has done it, so I take it down and join the line and another group follows. About a minute later a cast member is next to us asking the man behind me,  did you take that chain down?  The guy looks at him all confused while cast member glares at him. I inform him it was me.  Why would you do that? Obviously we closed it!  I explain the first cast member directed us down this lane so I figured a kid had played with it. No, no way, it was done on purpose and why would I touch it! Back and forth until I finally have to say,  ok, what do you want me to do now? Stay here or go back to the chain?  So back we go with the people behind us following for redirect. Cast member follows us and actually says,  it's just logical that you shouldn't pass the chain  as he points to the chain across the path. I just glare. Then he says something again, and again! Finally I tell him by name to  just stop . Nope, he's not able. He continues and four more times I tell him to stop talking, so many times we overheard the lady behind us tell her man how unbelievable this guy is being. I inform him his behavior is not that of disney standards and he tells me again how illogical I am...I eventually call him a d*% head under my breathe to my husband. Member hears and continues! Ugh. Just let me on the tram!!! You know, all he had to do from the start was just walk over and politely state,  ma'am, can you please come this way so I can redirect the line?  Simple, right? Nope, prefer to argue with me, the customer that has spent well over 4k euros and basically call me stupid.7) back to the first complaint filed: after telling girl in customer service I wanted to file a complaint, then told her why when she asked, she actually stated,  well, that was two yrs ago  (about running out of kids meals). Yes, but she totally missed the point that that was two yrs ago and am now two yrs later complaining about another food running out and a restaurant closing before closing time. She eventually calls the restaurant and informs me that, no, they close at 10 so it's not possible that they closed at 9:35. Well, I stood there and I should know so, yes, it is possible they were closed...I couldn't get any food.  It's not possible.  She must have said this 5 times. Eventually I tell her I just want to file a complaint but now I want a manager. No, she reused to get one! What!?! I asked another staffer standing there to get a manager and her reply was,  I don't know the situation.  OMG! I insist again from the first girl, and then again as she tells me no. I inform her I won't leave until one comes out. She has me wait in a room. When she returned, she said,  ok, I spoke to a manager and they say it could be possible the restaurant was closed early for technical reasons.  Good, glad you finally admit it's possible, now I still want to see the manager. Again, this could have all been avoided if she had just given me the form to fill out my complaint about running out of food and not listing restaurant hours on the map. I did speak with a manager.8) toilets, not very clean, although better than what you find in the city of Paris which is really bad.9) the frozen welcome is an actual parade of several floats in Orlando. This one is just a carriage with the two sisters. That's it. No more to it. Do not waste your time trying to get a spot for it. 10) be at any parade or the fireworks show pretty early if you want any space. People start sitting in the road, walkways and even on the fenced off grass about 2 hrs before the fireworks and 45 minutes before the parade. 11) the big wheel boat, it stops by 6 pm. Also information that's not on the map...12) the big giant balloon at the Disney village lake, it is supposed to be open all day to 11 pm. Nope. Closed twice when we went. Had a sign in the window that said it was closed due to the weather....you mean the clear blue sky with minimal wind and no rain in the forecast for three days? Yes, it must be that rain in a few days because surely that effects the way this balloon moves today. We supposed it is because there wasn't a line so they closed due to lack of interest. In that case, maybe the website should say to call to verify if opened instead of hours it's (but really isn't) open.13) we ate at two           restaurants, and both had the same initial problem, no wait staff for at least 10 minutes. At least bring us some chips or bread and water! But the food was delicious at both.So, I'm exhausted from all this. There is probably more but I am now tired and irritated from rehashing the issues. I'll leave you with this, I haven't been contacted by any Disney staff since the first complaint filed.

862,288330051,2,2015-7,United Kingdom,"Had a 5 day holiday here and personally I would have given it 1 star but rest of family said two. Stayed in a Disney hotel which was clean and basically a place to sleep. The park itself had quite a few rides not on from space mountain, nautilas, merry go round, flying carpets, etc. However this alone was not the only problem. The queuing system at this park is atrocious. All systems which involve queuing will have issues but the method at this park is very bad. Some rides have fast pass but a lot of the time you couldn't get them because the machines were off. And of those rides that didn't have fast pass people still managed to queue jump as they used what is meant to be a disabled facility to do so. Disney has also issued passes to  cast  which was a big gripe, from the guy and his daughter riding autoptia 4 times alone while we were in the queue, to the 2 women who thought that because they had such a pass to queue jump at the ice cream counter where not only had everyone queued for over half an hour but that they found it acceptable to do so to a child of about 7 in front of us with no feeling of embarrassment. I first became aware of these cards when a family of 4 jumped the queue at the best hot dog place if you know how long you have to wait there to get to the front to be usurped by someone saying they have a disabled card when its a cast card and that they are as healthy as anything it's frustrating to say the least, I don't disagree with the disabled part of it,because I think that's great that they accommodate this,it's the misuse of this system which is extremely prevelant at this park that I object to because this causes the queuing of everyone else to be longer than necessary, and having to view it so blatantly is what upsets the paying customer. Furthermore we didn't use it but feel for those wishing to visit princess pavilion as you have to queue for reservations to see them, as hotel guests we were in the park early but if you are visiting for the day the chances of getting one are unlikely as by 11 there always seemed to be none left. There were other things that let this park down but the queuing was the main problem. The parade and fireworks display were about the best thing and most staff were pleasantpleasant, however when they speak not only in French but in other languages many seem to think that they have to do it in as little time as possible that you have no idea what they have said.

Would never go again and strongly advise parents to find another park to go to... there is another fantastic park around Paris that we went to with rides etc and no waiting.

Staff were not 'disneylike' and hardly spoke regardless of what language. I can converse in three languages yet none of the staff could give a hoot. Just basically ignored people. Even in most shops there were four or five cash registers yet only one open at a time and a line formed for a massive wait time just to purchase a toy. Very slack work ethic. Hardly any characters around either for the little kids. In four days I saw Pinocchio, eeyore, and lilo and stich. That's it! In Usa, the characters are in every land all the time, the place is clean, and the staff magical to combine a magical experience.

In most of the cases, lines to most of the rides were between 30 and 60 minutes of wait, which, considering hot weather and lack of shadow in some of the most popular rides lines, was unacceptable. I tried the fast pass option, but waiting time for the fast pass was around 6 7 hours   for example, trying to get tickets for the Piter Pen's flight at 11 AM resulted in tickets to 17:55PM. At this rate, there is absolutely no way that visitor can use the 2 Parks hopper ticket, you spend most of the time in lines and when you're finished   it is 11 PM and you have no time left to visit the second park.  So my advice is to order your tickets for one park only   you'll save some money and won't be that disappointed.  Food is overpriced and small frozen Micky Pizza costs 12 Euro, which is almost the price of really great freshly made pizza elsewhere. Same goes for the drinks, ice cream and snacks. Even at seemingly high class restaurants the food is average at best and overpriced to the level of Michelin star restaurants.  Frozen  special appearance by Anna and Elza is no more than carriage ride with actors opening their mouth to the theme song of the movie. I was utterly disappointed and even my daughter said that Elza was  strange, made funny faces and her mimics was unnatural . Afternoon Disney Parade was actually quite nice, but once again, huge crowds prevented all but tallest people or kids on parents shoulders to get a clear view of the characters.  Light show on the castle was actually impressive, but it starts too late and some children just don't make it to that hour (11pm).Long story short   come before or after summer and maybe you'll have your chance to enjoy that place.

876,285563226,1,2015-7,United Kingdom,"Just back from a family trip to EuroDisney Paris. It was everything I feared it would be ... but far worse! To sum up my experience in three words: Queues, queues, queues.The bad. The weather was unbearably hot, 100F, not Disney's fault I know this would not have been nearly as bad if it wasn't for all the time required to be outdoors queuing. I would never go again in summer. Food overpriced. Merchandise overpriced. Not enough picnic and play areas. Kids got bored and tetchy with queues. The good   the staff were all very friendly and well trained whilst doing a very stressful job with stressed customers. Felt safe on rides. The other guests were also very polite despite the sufferance. Shame that smoking was allowed in the park. I know outdoors but why should I have to breath in other peoples filth whilst standing in queues and watching parades? Parade good. Park buildings and landscaping lovely.Monday. I arrived by packed shuttle bus which was full to bursting and crawled through rush hour traffic. I waited 15 minutes to get my bag xrayed at security. I then waited thirty minutes to get my pre paid ticket even though the queue was short and the counters fully manned. Why is this process so slow when the kids are desperate to get into the park. I then waited ten more minutes at park entry. I then set off to 'Adventureland' and walked to the Pirates ride and waited forty minutes   which then promptly shut down due to a technical fault just as I was about to board. So we went instead to the haunted house which said 15 minutes queuing time but which was 45 minutes in extreme heat. Haunted house story was all in French and therefore meaningless. And that was my morning. In the afternoon thought about the Frozen sing a long but queues were prohibitive. Went on Thundermountain in afternoon with a fastpass ticket   it was good but still had to wait twenty minutes. Gave up with other rides due to queues and went to some of the lesser attractions instead. Tuesday: Walked thirty minutes to park to avoid bus overcrowding. Found secondary entrance with no queues. Went to 'Fantasyland' but Peterpan ride shut due to technical fault. Did a few rides but generally disappointed with the quality and length of rides. Not nearly as good as I'd expected. Waited an hour for the star wars simulator which was good but not worth the tortuous queue. Queues for toilet, queues for water fountain. Gave up and retreated to hotel at this point and returned in the evening. Evening parade good. Jaques Cousteaux future ride closed. Gave up queuing for Automania. Went to rockets instead   said 15 minute queue but was twice that for 1 minute ride. Laser firework show at castle excellent and highlight of show..Wednesday: went to Disney studios park. Rushed to Crush ride early to avoid queues only to wait 70 minutes for a 60 second rollarcoaster in the dark. Massively disappointed. Meanwhile, another family member had to wait 20minutes just to get a fastpass ticket for Ratatouie. Went to a animalmajique show which was pants. Went to Ratatouie which had just broken down. So gave up and went back to the hotel for a swim instead. Thursday. Had a morning before flying home. Tried to go on rides that had been unable to get on previously. But pirates shut again. When did return, queues forty minutes long and, unlike my companions, I was not prepared to endure. Went on 'behind the scenes' tram   which was just garbage. Peter Pan ride was closed again but then reopened. It was so dark I couldn't see anything! I'm told this is a problem in the summer because there is not time to allow your eyes to adjust! Summary. Any other company expecting families with young children to queue for hours in the baking sun would be prosecuted for child abuse! I don't understand why people tolerate the queues ... the park clearly is all about the rides and yet can't accommodate so many people. The same people that would blow a fuse if they had to wait for half an hour in an airport security line for a two hour,   60 plane trip seem to be remarkably tollerant when waiting an hour and more for a sixty second mickey mouse ride with their family   when they have paid thousands of pounds for the privilege. Everywhere I looked I saw strained parents and frustrated kids all frazzling in the heat. Disney are so sneaky about the queues. First you stand for twenty minutes in the sun to get to the entrance of the attraction, and the queue doesn't look so bad; then you turn a corner to be confronted with a cattle shed of people twisting back and forth hidden round the side of the attraction  thirty more minutes; then you enter the building where you spend another twenty minutes in corridors constantly going round bends but not knowing how much longer you have to endure.

I never went to disney world as a child, but i had these visions implanted from movies of Walt Disney personally greeting visitors, Mickey Mouse surrounded by kids and a beautiful Cinderella leaning over and patting the heads of little princess wannabies... And fair enough... A Saturday in June is not the best time to go, and i guess 70 minute queues to most attractions and multiple attractions closed is what i should have been expecting and been mentally prepared for... But Donald cordoned off? Mickey not publicly available... Seriously, with the prices that are being charged, could this place not afford to have 20 people in Mickey Mouse suits canvassing the area so that all kids get to shake hands with the worlds most famous mouse? why do you queue for 40 minutes at a fast food bar that serves 3 set menus when there are no more than 5 people ahead of you? Don't get me wrong, the few rides we managed to do, the kids really enjoyed, but how do you respond to a 3 year old who asks you: mummy, you said this was Mickeys house, so where is he ?Despite everything, the kids liked it.

The fast pass was useless unless you managed to get one first thing in the morning, by lunch time the fast passes had either run out or the next available slot was after 6pm. When you have managed to get a fast pass you cannot get another one until you have used your first one so if your fast pass ticket is for later in the day you cannot get any others. At one point the queue to get a fast pass was over 20 minutes long!!Another disappointing thing was how miserable the staff are, this is Disneyland and they could barely break into a smile. So many rides  areas were closed, I have never seen to many green boarded up areas before.It's a small world ride was absolutely stinking dirty the floor under the water outside was green with fungus and during the ride we saw empty crisp packets and drink bottles floating around.Crowd wise I don't know how this park functions during it's peak times when it was at bursting point in June with just the Spanish school children on holiday. If you are yet to book I would highly recommend you check the European school holidays as it seems with even just the one country on holiday it makes a huge difference. On a positive note, the firework show in the night (11pm!) was fantastic, Crush's Coaster ride was fantastic but the waiting times were awful.

The problem was the parks, starting with the vast car park, travelators not working. It took 30 mins from entering the car park to reaching the entrance. We took advantage of the Magic hours on second day and got straight into the car park and managed to park in the A zone Hooray..only to find that the Studios was closed and the queue for the main park with only 1 gate open was at least 200 people long. 40 mins later we were inside, headed straight to Adventure land..

The experience started off poorly as our attempt to obtain park tickets and information on their telephone system left us frustrated and annoyed. The recorded message was entirely in french and the voice recorded message informed us that the call would cost .15 euros minute. Failing to obtain park information, we headed directly to the park. Upon entering, our first disappointment was with the ticket agent selling the admission tickets. This individual did not have the  Disney  enthusisam and showed attitude to our general questions. No welcome to Disneyland, lackluster personality and showed zero interest of being there. Moving on into the park, we noticed a general lack of overall upkeep of the park. Litter was visible throughout the park, peeling paint on the attraction buildings, garbage cans hygienically filthy, visible litter, smelly washrooms and general lacking of overall care of the park. Employees of WDW take pride in the employment and maintaining of the Disney brand. An obvious disconnect at Disneyland Paris. Arriving mid morning, we headed to the most popular attractions. 4 out of 5 rides were mechanically not operable, employees had no idea as to how long the rides would be shut down, nor did it appear that they cared. We did manage to participate in a few rides, but certainly not worth the time and the eruros spent to enter the park. Food was below par, and consequently many individuals were eating their own lunches. If one never has the chance to visit Walt Disney World in Florida, Disneyland Paris is better than nothing, especially if you know no better.

895,280334750,2,2015-5,Belgium,"OK, so I am a fan of rollercoasters and theme park and I have travelled to the US to visit some of the theme parks in Orlando as well as visiting some theme parks in Europe (Phantasialand, Asterix, Niglooland... to name a few recent ones). I have been able to put off a visit to the Disney franchise but since we now have young kids, I was no longer able to put it off. We had to go to Disney. Here I am, in my ignorance, thinking that Disney is like McDonalds: wherever you go it looks and tastes the same. Mistake  1: the attractions are *NOT* US size and thrill factor (Tower Of Terror is my main reference here) What you get in Paris is travelling fairground factor. What I expected was what I saw in Orlando (in what was called Universal's Islands of Adventure back than). I also excepted things to be spic and span; Disney is reputed for having the neatest parc in the world. Or so I've always been told. Now the parc is clean, the grass, trees, and all greenery is immaculate. Except for this: every single ride we went on had something faulty or out of order ond it (belts that don't work, carts that are taped off,... etc) Our friends even lined up for about 30 minutes to go on a simple ride, only to be sent away because it broke down... (they did fix it later in the day). One of the main roller coasters was closed off entirely for an hour or so in the afternoon!! Imagine how I felt.And here is what killed me: the lines stretched to sometimes over 2 hours, it was an extended holliday weekend in May. Fine. So they have a FastPass system in place (you take you ticket to a automatic machine, scan it and get a skip the line queue: max waiting time 20 mins guaranteed). Cool! But when 4 out of 5 of the fastpass ticket machines are not working, and there is a queue of 30 40 minutes to get a ticket that allows you to stand in queue for 20 mins, that's where I draw the line! This is the thing that really did it. So here is my advice: go there in winter, when there's no queues. Check the website to see which attractions are under construction maintenance (Space Mountain was announced under maintance   no discounts no refunds) and book well in advance to not pay full price (difference between 3 4 months up front and 4 weeks upfront can be 100%!) Or better: to enjoy your value for money go to any of these parks: Asterix   Phantasialand   Niglooland (best value money)   Efteling.

I hate being negative but I was very disappointed. I was prepared for the fact that it was smaller than California and Florida and didn't have very high expectations after talking to a few people that had been there but I still wanted to go to say that I had been there. In hindsight, I wish we hadn't spent the money or took the time to go. I will try to be as positive as possible.I liked the fact that it was easy to get there from our hotel. Train system is so efficient and found it very easy to go. Entering was very easy and didn't have a massive line up. We bought the hopper pass so that we could go to both parks but didn't go on one ride in Walt Disney Studios. The only ride that was of interest was the Tower of Terror and the fast pass wasn't working and at that point we were so disillusioned that we didn't want to stay in line for one hour. There were definitely more rides for very young children so it might be appealing to families with younger children (5 8) but the ride issue was only a small portion of what was disappointing.I was use to the Disneyland that is clean, friendly, smoke free and has a positive atmosphere, regardless of long line ups. There are areas for people to smoke but that rule was not enforced or followed. People were actually smoking in line ups to rides and pretty much all over the park in all areas.In California and Florida, I always enjoyed the friendly staff all over the park, whether they were characters or guiding the long line  ups. Not so here. We only went on a couple rides and the staff were not dressed up nor were they friendly. (Except for the characters that were posing for pictures with the children) There were no birthday or special occasion buttons that I always thought was a great touch. Maybe an off day... hopefully.

We went to Casey's Corner which was a catastrophe. It was dirty, the cast members were slow and talking and in no rush to get people their food in a timely manner.The Downtown Disney section of Disneyland Paris was hardly a downtown Disney area. I will say that there are some special rides that Disneyland Paris. The Crush roller coaster was amazing and the few rides were very cool.

906,276119131,2,2015-5,United Kingdom,"I have been to Disneyland Paris quite a few times. The first time was in 1992 when it first opened.Back in '92 It was expensive but well organised and the staff in general were polite and helpful. They had a happy and friendly disposition which you would expect from a theme park.I am sad to say that the original park has deteriorated and in need of a make over. The restaurants and rides are generally unresourced which makes the whole experience painful.You would for example not expect there to be long queues just to get into a restaurant. We pre booked all of our restaurants but still had to queue to get in. A 1:00 pm reservation turned out to be an actual 1:35 get into the restaurant followed by slow service. This was more a staffing issue (presumably to save money)I was also disappointed by the number of rides being refurbished. When you pay   50 00 to get in to a park, you expect to see all of it, not 85%. but at least they are refurbishing the place as it does look tired. Closed rides included space mountain, the Jules Vernes experience, etc. Some rides were closed due to technical reasons including the Aerosmith ride and thunder mountain. (I thnk some serious maintenance is required)So what else can be done to improve the experience?Add a few benches for people to sit on. There are very few places to sit, especially if you are wobbly on your legs.Fit better signage. You can spend quite a while finding things. A few extra well placed signs would go a long way.(signs in English, German, Italian, Spanish etc would not go amiss)Transport.Getting from the 'charles de gaulle' airport was a nightmare. The airport is very large and poorly signed. We laned at terminal 2 and had a train journey from the terminal to our baggage carousel. A journey of 20 30 mins. None of this was explained and we found the staff ignorant and rude.The actual bus transfer from the airport to the resort was also an experience. The driver spoke no english despte the fact that all passengers were from england. I can spek some French so I could understand the instructions (to an extent). The bus assistnat made NO ATTEMPT to help passengers with there luggage. He merely watched passengers of all ages putting there own luggage on the bus. (lazy and rude)The driver yelled 'Quelle Hotel' which i could understand but many travellers could not understand his ruse questioning.The hotel staff at the Sequoia were excellent. Friendly, well spoken and very helpful.The hotel was clean and quiet.You could walk from the hotel into Disneyland (10 15 mins) or catch a shuttle bus. Again no explanation by the driver that you needed to get off at the train station and walk 500 metres into the park.FoodAs was previously, the cost of food in the park is very expensive. I would recommend buying the food vouchers before you go, but dont buy a full board option, opt for the half board. You will get too tied down watching the clock for your next meal time.A half board option lets you choose a lunch time treat (tere are lots of places to get sandwiches, burgers etc...i.e. Earl of Sandwich, McDonalds etc)The meal vouchers are poorly explained but please note that you should book your restaurants early as the restaurants get full and you may not be able to get in. Also, some restaurants are only open lunch time ot tea time (some both)Beer is not always available...we found beer available at tea time but not lunchtime in some restaurants.Restaurants were understaffed and the service slow. The odd restaurants were however excellent i.e. Walts restaurant on Main street.We booked our restaurants on the first day (of a 5 day holiday) and the best time we could get into Cafe Disney (for a character dinner) was at 10:00pm. Not good enough when you have a 1 year old and a 5 year old.Menus also need a clarification which states which level of meal voucher you are using. We had a 'plus' meal voucher which allows you to use a certain number of selected restaurants and a particular set of meals.... this is unclear and it is easy to order food that is not on your meal plan.Snack Vouchersyou also get a set of snack vouchers which we found wee useless. You can only redeem these at certain times in certain venues. WE ended up throwing ours away. They need to be available for use all day and in all venues to be of any use.SmokingSmoking is allowed in the park...Entry TimeIf you visit by car and for the day, you will only be able to get in after 10:00am. Be prepared to queue for 30mins or more to get in.For people stopping in the complex, i.e. any hotel or the camp davey crocket, then you can get in at 8:00 but note that not all rides are open at 8:00 so it is a little bit misleading.Also, you need to access the park by the right hand queue (poorly signed) and show your disney hotel pass ID card. This gets you past the longer queues (day tripper queues)Ride Waiting TimesTimes displayed on the waiting time boards ere not particularly accurate. 10 mins could mean 20mins etc.Overall scoreI will go to Florida next time as the french resort is dated and in much need of a make over.

We were lucky that we managed to get on the majority of the rides we had planned on and they are still loads of fun. Space Mountain especially is fantastic. The food is very much overpriced and the magic of Orlando is indeed missing here but all things aside we had an enjoyable day and were able to see the funny side of the parks shortcomings. I would hesitate recommending a visit until the park is updated. Being in my 30s and going with a friend we could manage our expectations and make the most of it but I can't help but feel sorry for families having to spend a fortune to bring their kids here and being short changed due to poor maintenance, worse food, demoralised and uncaring staff and rude patrons. Poor show, Disney. Take some of the ridiculous amount of revenue generated by Frozen and spend it on giving this park a lick of paint.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

There were no Disney characters wandering about, you had to queue to see them. The parade was the best part of the day but only lasted 20 minutes. There was no character to the park, you could of been any where. You are better off going to one of the theme parks in England. Toilet facilities were smelly and food vastly overpriced.

The queues were chaotic.In my mind, I began to question if Disney had any management control over people volumes and subsequent health and safety on that basis ; I saw no evidence of any moves to stop people entering on the basis of number control.Canned music around the parks piped throspeakers didnt add to the magic of the place, reminded me of the Orwell novel 1984.No sign of any Disney characters , had they been laid off and replaced by automation?The most worrying experience was the breakdown of a major ride   the entrance was long and dark, taking over an hour for people to channel through narrow tunnels and then came to a shuddering halt for us as we approached the ride. Young children were upset, parents were frustrated and frantic efforts to sort the ride ended for people after about 20 minutes when people were channelled out the exit. This was the final straw to an already disappointing day for my sons and me.We left the park exhausted, dejected and my sons were disappointed with the whole experience ; I personally found the whole day stressful as there was no knowing if and how we could manage to do the rides we wanted under these conditions.Hardly the  Happiest Place on Earth , and I could see few happy faces leaving the parks.I could not recommend this place and would rather spend a day at Alton Towers and ensure I get my moneys worth , and happier sons.

We stayed at the Cheyenne on a half board plus basis.It felt like a cross between Butlins and Alton Towers, and I am afraid it wasn't the 'Disney Magic' at all.The journey, by air, from the UK was over 8 hours from home to CDG airport. Once there, signage to Disney was not obvious and this took some time to work out how to get to Disney. We took the TGV train   great took 9 minutes   normal train is about 50mins.On arrival at Disney there is no welcome, in fact over the 5 days most staff were unfriendly. At the hotel, no welcome. The rooms are basic   the key card for the door was intermittent, the safe didn't work and needed a new battery, the TV remote needed a new battery, the towels were tiny.Breakfast   this is a cattle market.

Everything opens to everyone from 10am.Fast pass   hotel users get a fastpass   this is a great idea   however it is very limited. you can only use one fastpass at a time   so if you arrive at say 10am, and the first ride you fast pass is for a time of 13.10 you can not fast pass any other ride until about 1300!. NOT all rides have fastpass. However, when you use it, it does save time.Most rides, whilst we were there were at least a 60 minute wait and some more.

To get a priority card you need to produce a letter from a doctor explaining what their issues are. We were able to go to the exit of the ride and on producing our card we would usually be ushered on within minutes. The usual wait times varied from 45 mins upwards   not something my son would have coped with. The staff treated us v well, polite and friendly. Within 2 days we were able to go on everything my son wanted with time to spare. In all we did about 26 rides shows. Ratatouille ride is fantastic at Disney Studios   did it twice and being in the front of the car for kids is really magical   so real. Food and shops very over priced and same stuff everywhere. Can recommend the pizza resturant in Adventure land,    38 for 2 adults and 1 child. We pre   booked a character breakfast at Mickeys Cafe at Disney Village which was fantastic otherwise we wouldn't have met any of the characters   this made the trip for my son and I totally recommend doing this. Also, when we got to the cafe on time there was a huge queue and I could see some people clutching their pre   booked vouchers. I simple went up to the front and held my voucher up at the glass door and they let us in straight away! We stayed at the Davey Crochett Ranch which was only 10 mins away by car. So glad we did this as it is a relief to get away from Disney and have some p&q. The cabin was immaculate and very tastfully decorated. The site is clean and peaceful. There is a shop, resturant, bar, play area and of course the pool, which was great. Plenty of floats and water wings for young kids.

Take cases to the room allocated. No Lifts so drag them up the stairs... Room although I realise it was a cheaper option we chose.. Basic it was.. Half board we went for and hotel buffet was not the best.. In fact cold and that was first evening.. Breakfast..Un organised.. No milk for child's cereals, fruit juice for children run out.. It was like going back to school dinners. Says pony rides for children, that was ponies going round a small circle at the rear of building.. Got a better ride at donkeys on local beach in England.. Pleased I didn't have large family as cost of a round of drinks is extortionate...Onto the park... If you want a shopping trip it's great... Never seen so many same old shops in one place.. Over priced... The worst bit.. All the young children dressed up as princesses and no princesses in sight.. Queue for an hour or more to have picture taken with princess, that's if they not on a break or come to the end of picture time before reaching the front.. Queue for a visit to the princess palace on the day for over an hour, get a ticket and get a time to return later that same day (if lucky) return at late afternoon to queue yet again.. And then... Wait for it... Two princesses on show ( not told which ones) and pot luck on which you get... What a let down... Hours in queue for a single princess..... Nothing for Frozen fans and bearing in mind most of the younger children were dressed as one or other.... SHAME ON THE PARK! No characters walking round just Queues Queues Queues...

Not sure if you can do that with breakfast with Micky but worth checking.TAKE PLENTY OF EURO'S ( you will need it)If you return to the hotel we stayed at early there are no play parks to keep your children occupied.Can play at the rear of pub but it is hard ground and a young lad fell and had to have a medic called for. Youths play football in the walkways outside of rooms so ask for a rear room especially if you have younger children who go to bed early.Fireworks so late for a four year old we never got to see them.On a plus granddaughter enjoyed it...

915,275091548,2,2015-5,United Kingdom,"Visited the Disneyland resort over the May half term school holidays, five days and four nights. And overall, what a let down. The biggest issue is that there just isn't much to do. I know that's hard to believe for somewhere like Disneyland, but it's true. For the main Disneyland Park their map lists 43 attractions. Of those, three were given as 'planned closures'   Space Mountain, Le Mysteres du Nautilus and Carrousel de Lancelot. Of course Space Mountain is one of the big attractions too. But then on top of that large swathes of the park are fenced off being 'renovated for your future enjoyment'. This includes Pirates Beach, Le Passage Enchante de Aladdin, Rustler Roundup Shooting Gallery and Videopolis, all closed off. Throw in the Chaparrel Theatre, which is unused and the Discoveryland Theatre which is just a dumping ground for a pile of arcade machines and that 43 attractions is suddenly down to 34. And of those four are stations on the same railroad and one is a barbers shop   so really there's about 30 things to do. On top of that the Big Thunder Mountain ride was broken down on the two occasions we tried to ride it, and we never saw any of the horse drawn streetcars. There are a couple of shows in the park plus the daily parade and the end of day Disney Dreams show. Although the parade and dreams shows are fairly good, the other shows are nothing much. A couple of characters riding around, that's pretty much it. As for meeting characters, you can pretty much forget it. There was a meet Mickey Mouse in what presumably used to be a theatre   where the whole area people could have sat in is used for the queue. Expect an hour or more to wait for this one. A Disney princess (just the one, clearly the budget doesn't stretch to more than one) where you can queue up for the privilege of getting a time to come back later and queue again. Then a couple of others dotted round the park for at most a few hours a day (you can spend much longer queuing up to meet Rapunzel than the 30 minutes she's out a day). Simply put, there's just not enough for the number of people in the park. As a result the one thing you can do lots of is queuing. A good hour or more per ride, even on some of the small children's carousels. Yes, there is a FastPass for some rides   four that were planned to be open, though one was then broken.

917,275046980,2,2015-5,United Kingdom,"Myself and my wife visited Euro Disney for her belated 50th Birthday celebrations. We stayed at the off site Magic Circus hotel from 23 5 to 26 5. We had a 2 day pass for the Parks for 24 5 and 25 5.Saturday 24 5 turned into probably the worst day of our lives.We got to the park at 10:45 and were greeted to a 15 minute, 1000 person long melee to get past security into the site. Once we had achieved this we got our tickets. As I had the foresight to pre book this we managed this bit quite speedily and hassle free. Once in the park we headed to the back as this was the quietest area. After a 15 minute queue to get on the    small world    ride we then managed to get onto    Casey Junior    and a boat fairy tale trip. It was now midday and the park was heaving with people. We decided to go on the    railroad    that circled the park. After a 40 minute wait we managed to get on the ride which lasted about 20 minutes. We started to queue for lunch at about 1:15 and after 20 25 minutes at what was the slowest    fast food    queue I had ever seen we managed to eat. It was now nearly 2pm so we made our way to    Phantom Manor   . Following a 45 minute queue we got inside the main door. After a 15 minute wait we were then told it had broken down and were ushered out an exit door, so a whole hour wasted. We plodded to    Big Thunder Mountain   , wait 100 minutes for a 90 second ride and the fast path not working, we decided against this so over to    Pirates of the Caribbean    and another hour wait. It was now about 4pm so we decided to get an ice cream and wait for the parade. After another 20 minute queue for ice cream we tried to get a spot for the parade. What a joke, people standing 5 deep with children on their shoulders so we could see sod all. In desperation at even getting on another ride we went back to the    Pirates of the Caribbean   . We queued for an hour and got on the ride, halfway through this came to a grinding halt. After sitting in the boat for 15 minutes staff in waders appeared to pull us to the side and we clambered out an emergency exit. To be fair they gave us a priority ticket to another ride as compensation but we had to stand in another queue for 15 minutes with people pushing and queue jumping to get the tickets! It was now 6:45 and exhausted we went back to the hotel to freshen up in order to come back for dinner and to see the fireworks at 11pm. We got back to the park at 8:45. Thinking we could get something decent to eat we made our way to the    Blue Lagoon    restaurant but were told as we hadn   t booked they can   t get us in. We went back to a burger restaurant, it closed 5 minutes earlier as had the pizza restaurant. So dinner was a croque monsieur at main street, there was no way we could get a table to sit at so we had to eat this sitting on the kerb dodging trampling feet! Now to the fireworks (literally). Stood on the pavement for an hour trying to stay in the spot where we could see. Barged aside by people with no thought for anyone but themselves and battered by pushchairs. 5 minutes before it was due to start some idiot stands right in front of us and puts his child on his shoulders so neither we nor the people behind us could see a thing. Before I could say anything the Brit behind me grabs the bloke and screams    cheers mate we   ve stood here for an hour and now none of us can see you selfish *!!*    people then started shoving and jostling before he finally moved. We watched the fireworks and made our way back to the bus queue to try and get the shuttle bus back to the hotel at 11:30. There were 2 buses for about 500 people. Everytime one came in a crush to try and get on the bus ensued, grown adults behaving like animals pushing and shoving little kids out the way to get on the bus, it was disgusting. One guy even physically threw another man off the bus into the waiting crowd as the driver couldn   t shut the door and he wouldn   t get off. After another 40 minute wait we finally got back to the hotel at 00:45 and fell in bed and the nightmare ended.   100 and 14 hours later we had got on 6 rides, 2 of which broke down, to stand in queues for hours and be shoved, jostled and treated like animals. This whole day has certainly changed my view on human behaviour some of which hardly separates humsans from apes. Monday in the    studio    was better but there was still a 2 hour (no I   m not kidding) wait for    Ratatouille    and 40 to 50 minutes for most other rides. The food queues were smaller but the place was still heaving.

This year in May 2015 I decided with my wife to take my granddaughter to Disneyland Paris. I went for six days, five nights and paid for the premium food package on full board basis. I stayed at the New York hotel within the resort. The hotel was Ok but expected more for a four star hotel. I had an early flight unfortunately and arrived at the resort at 1020 am . I was told on check in that the room was not ready till 3 pm. Not good when you have a four year old who has been up and travelling since 4am. In most hotels in Europe rooms are usually available at mid day. I noticed that the tiles in the bathroom were cracked along the bottom by the floor and the beds were like sleeping on wooden pallets. The Disney parks were a let down, seven of the rides in both parks were broken (this you are not told before you book or arrive at location) The park was somewhat dirty and even though you saw cleaning staff around they were more interested in walking in three's and fours,talking,smoking and basically not doing what they were paid to do. The plants and shrubs and supposedly manicured areas were un kept. The buildings of the rides looked tired with worn out paint. The majority of staff were polite but I found that on some of the rides for children like the Rocket, Dumbo, mad hatters rides the more the queue's the less time you had to ride . It appeared that because of the queues one or two of the rides lasted only 1min 10sec.This park is very different to the USA parks, This park is very small and you can get round comfortably in about 2 and a half days. We queued for some 2hours forty minutes to get a picture and signature from one of the princesses. It was almost that for the other characters.You had to queue at 1030 in the morn to get a ticket for the princess pavilion but were then told your child could only see one and not any of the the others. The queues for other rides were deceptive it would say 5 mins when it fact it was 40 minutes when you passed the gate. How do you tell a child they cant go on it. Thank god she was an angel throughout the whole trip and we queued where necessary. People may say I'm just complaining but when you go to the US parks you kind of expect DISNEY to provide at least the same or similar don't you?. I must mention the meal plans. These are cruelly deceptive. I went for a full board premium plan and was told I could eat what I wanted from the menu and in any restaurant within the Disney resort I wanted. Not if you don't have a reservation!!!!!!! How can you reserve for a four year old. The premium plan allows you to choose from the al acarte menu but in some of the restaurants they have the premium plan menu, two starters, three main and three deserts to choose from wow!! All this for 125 euro ( $160) per meal for three. A meal for three could cost you as much as $200 plus If you don't buy the meal plans. There are other lower plans but the food is just as bad. Didn't know my child would be restricted to froi gras or smoked salmon. I expected far more choice for what I paid. This they don't tell you when you book your holiday!!!! I was told that the premier restaurants was the California grill in the Disneyland hotel . Two things to say about that, bad, cold food, very poor service. The character meals they sell, you expect to see a lot of them there we saw four character at one meal and three princesses at another and we had to wait over an hour to see the first princess and drank water waiting for the others as we had already eaten our meal. When I got fed up with the rubbish food I went to a deli who stated that she would not take my voucher for a cheese and ham sandwich. Eventually a manage from Walts restaurant kindly helped us out an the voucher was accepted. We ate at the Lucky nugget, they took our vouchers and explained that we would lose money by eating there we understood but had a great burger. I will say go the the Buffalo Bill dinner show that was the best!!!The trip overall was disappointing considering the cost we paid. In hindsight I would have taken her to the USA for that little extra. Don't get the premium plans there not worth it.!!!!! All in all my grand daughter had a great time and we made it as best we could but I will not go back there and would advise others to think about it before going to DISNEYLAND PARIS.

She is five and a bit and is crazy about Frozen, Tinker Bell, Belle   the usual stuff. So, three of us went. We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch, one of Disney hotels. This will be a separate review. Loved it (Davy Crockett), by the way.Disney positives: The fireworks show, which starts at 10:30pm, is bloody awesome. The daily parade of Disney characters (around 5:30pm) is worth seeing at least once. Your child will love it.The train journey around the park is a sneaky way to rest your feet   you can ride on and on, it goes around in circles and you don't have to get off.That's all, folks! Now the negatives and why we are not coming back:Smoking. I have nothing against people who smoke. I can have a cheeky one myself. Now and again. But never ever in front of a child or where a child might see me. In Disneyland you can smoke anywhere. Literally   anywhere! This is a children's theme park, last I checked, and your child can get a whiff of second hand smoke even in a queue of Crush Coaster Nemo ride. Lots of people smoking   in front of their children, in front of my child... This is just wrong. Hated it.Queues   we all know that one has to queue at Disney, but as it turns out the wait at most (no, scrap that   ALL) rides is at least an hour, usually just under two hours. And then the ride lasts 3 5 minutes. Disney might say  oh, but it's because the rides are so popular! . I say    it's because of rubbish organisation and planning. . As much as my child is dedicated to Disney, it's a torture to have her wait five hours to go on three rides.Food. It's very overpriced and very inedible. You'll find that everywhere, in all different restaurants, they have the same menu, same prices and same quality. My waiter was very apologetic, he knew exactly what I meant when I said this was the worst food we ever put in our mouths in France. Of course, there's an option of packing your own lunch, but we just don't like to carry more than we absolutely have to. Imagine 30 degrees heat, you are fighting your way through a crowd, with a tired child, with a backpack stuffed of half melted sandwiches on your back...There are no Disney characters out in the park for kids to cuddle up to and have a photo taken with. You know how they show Disney Florida TV adverts and there's always a kid hugging a Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse? I expected those to just roam the streets of Disney Town. None of that. Not a single Mickey to be hugged or photographed. Maybe it's just not a French thing...So, that's it, really. As great as the fireworks show and the parade were, it is way outweighed by excessively long queues, smoking all around, and overpriced and bad food everywhere. No Disney magic for us.

However from the minute we first entered the gates we were already let down by the attention of detail compared to Japan! However we continued on with a open mind. A positive were the lines were definitely shorter than Japans as there is alot less people visiting the park. Once we had been on a couple of rides we noticed a huge difference between the parks! its actually disappointing to see that there is a massive difference, wether this is due to the park being older im assuming. The Park is well over due for a major refurb. The food definitely needs attention to as there is limited food options that are at the reasonable price. 60 euros for a steak is beyond a joke! This park is missing the Disney feel we got from Japans park. I think management needs to go check out the difference of quality between these two as we were not the only ones to say this. Two other couples we spoke to said the same thing but with Florida and California being better. Ino people made read this and think this is harsh however its reality. If this is your first disney experience you can only go upwards from here.Likes:All roller coaster ridesoption of two parkschuros stand at the entrance before entering the parkDislikes:Smoking throughout the park especially in lines, when there is dedicated smoking areas.

Throughout the entire day (9:30 18:00) we did not see one single princess. The closest we got was Alice who had a group of unruly children around her. Our daughter has been brought up to queue and wait her turn. She was stood directly in front of Alice for 20 minutes whilst she systematically worked around the children from one side to the other, purposely missing our daughter every time. We waited and waited, then eventually someone came to tell her to leave so they decided a rushed group photo would have to do, then left. Thanks Alice for that lasting childhood memory for our daughter. My advice for anyone else going is just shove your kid to the front and don't give a damn about any other kids, as this seems to be the disney way.Thunder mountain broke whilst we were in the queue, so did the Peter Pan ride, so we couldn't go on these.

Expectations were high to be fair, you hear so much about Disneyland that you expect the best and of course pay a premium for such however, the trip itself didn't meet my personal high expectations and I'm not sure if thats just me being fussy or maybe just unlucky?We booked into Newport Bay hotel, which is on site and allows earlier access to the park, two hour before the general public. This hotel itself is being renovated, when we booked we were told 'minor renovations' were being undertaken but came to find the hotel covered in scaffolding and majority of the ground floor lounge etc closed. The first impressions weren't improved upon when our party got stuck in a lift for 20 minutes when trying to make our way to the rooms (which were provided ahead of check in time to be fair).The rooms itself was very standard, views were none existent due to scaffolding and builders working outside the window. The decor looked very dated and I assume is part of whats promoted the renovations (be them classed as minor or major!).The park itself   of course the kids got delirious with excitement when they saw the entrance and given their age, were happy with all the attractions and shows we took them to however, we did find a large proportion of rides close due to faults (thunder mountain, tea cups, big pirate ship, slinky dog, dumbo ..... amongst others).Cost of food in the parks themselves was extortionate and very poor quality. The waiting time for said food was terrible, we went half board and as part of the deal got a 'tea time treat'..... these were used once on all the days there as we found only a few selected places took the vouchers and those that did had waits longer than major rides!!Staff working were generally very good, cheery and happy to help except when on one ride I felt the sharp edge of a young french ladies tongue for returning a hat that had been left on the tom sawyer ride..... I was hoping to catch her name at the end of the ride but she strangely seemed to have disappeared!Character photo opportunities are plenty on the park, albeit with a sizeable queue event before the park opens to the general public.

We were inspired by this park 10years ago, when came here first time and had seen all park's attraction in 1 day. This time we were proud to open this paradise for our little kids, who were dreaming about it. But this   time the paradise was lost, our kids said, they do not want to come here again. I believe that Paradise was lost by it's formal management. In order to see all attractions here, one have to spend average 70% of time in waiting to get to attractions. Fast pass: it does not work any more like 10 years ago, fast pass's slots were turned off at 1pm, and to get to all famous attractions you had to wait about 60 minutes on each. Unfortunately we had short vacation and do not have time to spend in Disney land park 3 days(10years ago we managed to explore 100% of attractions in 1 day). I mentioned management,   of course this is the reason of our unsuccessful vacation. I tried to speak with some staff asking advise how to get solution, because we do not have enough time to complete our tour, but received just formal replied like  it is policy for all  .

When my son was a baby it got our daughter double rides as she was able to get on again with the second parent. We stayed in Sequoia Lodge this visit, having previously thought the Disney Hotel was a waste of money. I would love to know who gives these hotels their ratings as they are both barely 3 star, the only advantage is the location of the Disney Hotel.

The price of everything which is well documented on here is extortionate and is only half the story. To eat you may need to go to a loan company first but then you are lucky to then EVEN get to eat. The restaurants are few and can't handle even a half full park. The first day after traipsing round with the kids and looking forward to somewhere to eat and sit down was an eye opener as you can't get a table unless you reserved it in advance which is ludicrous.When we visited over Easter, Space Mountain was closed, so was the Haunted Mansion, the Runaway Mine train had a fault(which was fixed by lunchtime(which is just to give you a timeline as we never actually got to eat)) and the Buzz Lightyear ride broke down as we were halfway round... I like the French but they revert to type on the ride changeovers. They are so slow at getting people off an attraction and new people on that it adds an eon to the queue time. Some of the rides are no better than local fairground rides..(step forward Snow White and Pinnochio)The shows are OK but are so dangerous as you get herded into these waiting areas before the doors are opened and people are jostling for the front that myself and my wife were keeping a firm grip on our girlsYou know that it is going to be a stamina slog with all the walking but you don't expect a law of the jungle attitude as people push, pull and are rude..Overall, it will be our one and only visit and if you are thinking of going, stick with Thorpe Park, Alton Towers, Blackpool Pleasure beach or one of the other theme parks.

However, the reality fell far short for reasons that could have been avoided.On our first day, a cast member shouted so rudely and aggressively at us for several minutes (as we   d walked the wrong way due to poor signage) that our 4 year old was reduced to tears. How any adult would behave in that manner around children is beyond me. The fact it happened at Disney a supposedly child friendly resort was astounding. When I tried to calmly explain our mistake and asked where to go he continued to verbally abuse us until another cast member came, spoke to him sharply in French, and helped us. Even after our return our daughter talks about the    nasty man on the train   , so shame on you Florian, you don   t deserve to work near children.The rides we went on were good, there were queues but that is to be expected. I did notice some of the larger rides were closed which would have been disappointing if our children had been older. Other guests we spoke to who had been before also said they were surprised by the amount of closures on the park.Whilst on the subject of queues, we queued to see Rapunzel. This took nearly 3 hours which is ridiculous and to me typified all that is wrong with DLP. We had two character dining experiences which couldn   t have been more different. Caf   Mickey, very basic food and poor service. It took nearly 2 hours to get a burger, when we complained we were told that the kitchen had messed up. I am glad that we did this though as otherwise we would only have seen the characters on parade and not met them. I was expecting to see them walking around the park but that didn   t happen. They spent time to get photos autographs at each table and given the queues to do this on the Park, it makes it worthwhile. So, I would recommend it but be prepared for a long wait. We went to the Auberge de Cendrillon for our daughter   s birthday and this meal was what made our stay. The staff, notably Salve our waiter, were brilliant. They were happy, conversational, helpful and professional just what you would expect from Disney but until then we hadn   t seen. Similarly, the princesses were great, Belle made our daughter   s day by singing happy birthday, even though she leaving to get ready for the parade. Snow White   s Prince Charming was also especially good with our young girls. Expensive but well worth it, given that we   d tried and failed twice to book at the Princess Pavillion.The evening parade was really good and had the Disney    feel    and it was only place where Frozen was represented. We were really disappointed by this, given the fact that most little girls adore Anna and Elsa. DLP must be the only place in the world where there is no Frozen frenzy! With a few tweaks, out of date attractions like Alice in Wonderland could be changed to represent the interests of this generation.So, overall the test of any theme park is would you return?

You only found this out when you get to the booth as the staff directing traffic are more bothered with getting people staying at the hotel in. Then after paying 15 Euros, yes really, to park we then line up to get your bags checked (not a problem, just have more staff on) Once in the park we realised that the whole parks credit card machines were down, but again you would only find this out once you got to the end of the line.But the worst thing was the amount of closed rides. Every high profile ride except the 'Runaway train' type ride was closed. Not just broken down, but covered and off. What the heck are we paying for, its defiantly not the happy atmosphere.

Firstly we love Disney so this is not a Disney knocking review and like a number of reviewers I would whole heartedly agree every child should get to visit Disney. Unfortunately, from the jewel of Europe in the 1990's Disney has sunk to an all time low with shops having very little merchandise, paint peeling from walls, no organisation at the main gate or bus station creating major risk to small children getting crushed in the push for both entrance and exit. However, they have maintained their high prices (Florida is also expensive don't let anyone tell you different) Back in the 1980's France was chosen and immediately the fears started to grow, these have now come home to roost, the staff now treat guests with distain and three of the main rides closed at the same time is poor planning on a park where there are so few rides anyway. The lack of shows to shelter from the winter weather is a major failure on the planners and the total lack of characters around the park embarrassing. Yes America is better, weather, size, etc but the big difference are the staff members who look like they are not serving a prison sentence. This is my fifth and final visit to Disney and Paris, what it had, it has lost. The most appalling part is having enter the park and then exit the park again to place your luggage in holding.

We had booked 2 rooms both with 2 double beds but they gave us rooms with just 1 bed in each so that was the 1st problem. They did change them with no bother but it all took time. Once we had dumped our bags we headed straight out to the Disney studios as its smaller so we thought save the main park for the full day on Saturday. Totally unimpressed. Absolute chaos and so disorganised. My daughter & granddaughter queued up 4 an hour just to have a photo taken with Mickey Mouse, which is fine but not when you have older adults pushing in front to get their photo taken with him and the staff not saying anything to them! We were a bit peckish after this so went to one of the (not very) fast food places for a snack. What a mistake. Yet another queue because they 'forgot' our order. They were extremely slow serving everyone and it didn't look very hygienic, or safe, cleaning down the work tops with a mini pressure washer. The tea was like dishwater and they used hot milk in it! In fact every cup of tea I had was made with hot milk! Awful. Anyway we only went on 2 rides because of the disorganised queues. We had booked Cafe Mickey for the 1st night and that was brilliant purely for the fact that the characters walk round and let you take photos with your child, my granddaughter loved it especially Tigger and Goofy. They made her giggle uncontrollably by tickling her under her chin and making a fuss of her and not just the once either. The food wasn't at all bad, didn't feel rushed and the waiter was lovely. The next day (Saturday) we set out for the main park. My god, I've never seen so many people pushing and shoving to get through the entrance barriers!

Atrocious behaviour from grown adults who couldn't give a fig about pushing toddlers and young children out of the way and the dismal land staff didn't help at all. The park was so busy we only went on a couple of rides and then we had to queue for ages. Some queues were advertising a 2 hour wait for rides and even queuing for a fast pass was up to an hour long! Went to Annette's Diner the 2nd night which was average for food and if you're on the plump side you wouldn't fit in the booths! The best bit was when the waiting staff burst into song and dance to Grease Lightning and encouraged diners to join in, great free floor show.

Customer service generally could best be described as glum. Despite it not being school holiday time in France the place was rammed. We queued first of all for an hour and while approaching the front were told that the ride had to close for safety reasons.We caught sight of Mickey on a walk about and made our way over to the large crowd hoping to meet him. He was cordoned off by minders who barked orders at young children and their parents. Horrible. Waited patiently for another 45 mins or so to try and meet him but time ran out and he was off.

We had already forked out 30 euros to kit the 3 of us out in rain jackets since it was tipping down and extra to stow our luggage ... while we were  enjoying the magic .

977,259473070,2,2015-3,United Kingdom,"Disney spent millions of Euro, Dollar, Pounds, building this place but failed to address the basic needs of children who cannot leave their wheelchairs! The park itself is accessible by wheelchairs but I believe this is purely because strollers   pushchairs are used rather than any thought of wheelchair access. This shows with the lack of drop curbs and where they do exist on one side of a road, they are not on another.There are also NO disabled changing facilities in the park. This meant we had to change our daughter on the floor of the toilet or as we had to do leave the park and return to our hotel to change her. Something which took a considerable amount of time and had to then re enter the park. They should speak to http:  www.changing places.org  on how to fit a changing room.On arrival you can go to the  Town Hall  where on proof of disability you are given a Green Priority card which outlines the disability. This provides you with no queuing access to rides and attractions.The reason I think it looks like wheelchair   disability access is an afterthought is that all the disabled access seems to be via the access of the rides and you have to go against the flow of sometimes 100's of people to get access. Some of who do not know that and can abuse you for going the wrong way. Also on some of the rides the staff try to load the wheelchair before everyone has exited the ride! This was particular on the flying carpets.Only 4 rides in the park seem to be used with a wheelchair and even then the staff refused us access to one of the rides because our wheelchair did not look  wheelchair  enough!! Not given the fact that our daughter who is 8 and has severe 4 limb cerebral palsy was obviously not able to sit unaided in the boat! only after a very loud argument causing embarrassment and distress were we finally allowed on the adapted boat for the Small World ride. The following day we put in a complaint at the town hall. We did feel our complaint was taken seriously. The Wonderful World of Disney does not seem to apply to those children who are always in wheelchairs. The majority of rides are for transfer from wheelchair only meaning that although you can get priority access to the ride you have to transfer out of the wheelchair to ride it. Many of the rides that have transfer only access do not have suitable seating for disabled children as they are just the plastic bench seats. What was upsetting   disappointing was the fact that some of the attractions that you would expect to be able to take a wheelchair on could not, such as the Disney train that goes around the park. How difficult is it to adapt this? the boats that show the classic childrens' stories requires transfer and even the tea cups need a transfer! We did not want or expect the major rides such as Hollywood Hotel, Parachute drop etc to be accessible as these are unsuitable for a child with severe disabilities, but there is no excuse for the basic ones.We found the staff on the Buzz Lightyear ride extremely helpful and the ride was a perfect example of wheelchair adaption. A mention must go to the staff on Armageddon who prior to the show talked us through exactly what was to happen, where to stand and most importantly how to exit the attraction quickly should our daughter become distressed. We were with a member of staff throughout and felt the staff had a full understanding of our needs   constraints.Whilst the park itself is a nice walk around with the wheelchair it is a disappointment having paid to come only being able to access about 4 rides. I think some work needs doing by Disney to allow the inclusion of children who are bound to their wheelchairs. The question is will they do it? I think sadly the answer is no, because they make their money! We did enjoy our holiday as it was our first one in 8 years since the birth of our daughter, we thought Disney would understand the needs of wheelchair bound children and were left sadly disappointed.This review will be absorbed into the 1000's of families who had a truly wonderful time, which I can say we would have had we not had a child in a wheelchair.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The park as a whole has some good rides but during our trip we encountered many rude guests and some rude staff. Queuing was disorganised and made more stressful than necessary, with many people pushing in front. When we were stepping off of thunder mountain my partner was grabbed on the shoulder and shoved hard enough to stumble, by a cast member. My partner was merely stepping of the ride as instructed and did not do anything to warrant being physically moved. It has always been my understanding and belief that members of staff, anywhere not just disney, should not physically touch guests outside of character interactions and playful gestures. This also meant that we became separated for a moment as he had been pushed in amongst the other people leaving, leaving me behind. The park could be good if it was not full of rude people.

We stopped at the Davy Crockett Ranch which I was pleased with but I will write a separate review for that. This review is for DLP. We are a family of 7, consisting of 2 adults & 5 kids aged 11, 10, 8, 6 and 2. It was half term so I expected it to be busy, but I did not expect the queues to ruin my time there. They were a nightmare. Queueing for 30 minutes is bad enough but lots of them were for 70 minutes! It states clearly at the beginning of the ride how long you will have to wait, but they have a clever strategy of hiding how long the queue is as most of it is concealed from view. My husband said he felt like Homer Simpson as every time he thought he was nearing the end DOH, turn the corner and there is another mile of queue! My 2 year old was a nightmare waiting as you can't constrain them in a buggy as you have to leave the buggy outside of the ride so he kept trying to run off. My other kids would get bored too, and would end up bickering with each other or climbing on the barriers (which you are not allowed to do). Tip   any electrical hand held device that you have, please take, it will help alleviate boredom and keep Mom & Dad from losing the plot! We paid for the half board option and I am so glad that we did as we would have spent a fortune otherwise. We did not spend hardly any money as I refuse to be conned by the extortionate prices that they charge for food, drinks, toys, clothes etc. We just took packed lunches into the park, with drinks and sat and had our lunch in one of the many picnic areas. I told the kids that if there was anything they wanted to buy, take a picture and I'll have a look on Amazon when I get back home for a 3rd of the price. Unsurprisingly there was nothing that they were desperate to get! The food in the restaurants was lovely. Plenty to choose from and a good variety. Although don't get choosing Billy Bobs, we went there the one night and we had to queue for about 30 minutes just to be seated. I booked my restaurant reservations before I went which I would recommend.The 5pm Parade is fun but the crowds ruin it for me. I was stressed out keeping an eye on all my children. Also, when it finishes, getting out of the park is a nightmare as everyone else is doing it to. The night time parade is fantastic. The castle being lit up with fireworks is wonderful, but again, it is so busy, getting a decent place to view it is hard work.I preferred Disney Studios to the park as I enjoyed the shows. The car stunt show was brilliant. Also, the timings for the various shows usually meant that you didn't have to queue for too long.There were a couple of parks but they were closed. This was disappointing as this would have given my husband and I a bit of chilling out time whilst the kids let off some steam (I have all boys who have lots of energy), as they were getting cheesed off with queueing. We used the free  magic hours , but everyone seemed to as well. Yes, it's quieter than midday, but still, you are looking at about 30 minute wait, if not more. We also used the free pass, but sometimes the queue to even get the free pass was ridiculous.Overall I'm glad we went as it was an experience but this was not a holiday for me it was more of a military mission. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had 1 or 2 children, but as my husband said, it would test the relationship of even the strongest of couples. Would I go back? No chance. Would I spend a fortune going to Florida? No. Give me a holiday where the kids have freedom to run about rather than being constrained to a queue and I can chill out, then I'm happy!

We have since visited Disneyland California   2010   and it certainly didn't disappoint. This time we hoped to recapture some of the magic when we visited for the day during a short Paris break, with just our younger son, aged 13. The day was no disaster, but standards had declined so dramatically since we were last here that I left feeling rather let down. We did both parks   Studios as well. On the plus side, the Animagique show was just as good as I remembered. My wife enjoyed Cinemagique while me and our son joined a queue. The Hollywood Tower Hotel was great and went some way to redeeming things. But otherwise? The park appeared tatty and dirty in places; I tripped on a large crack in the pavement. Statues were covered in bird droppings. Seats in the Cinemagique auditorium were broken and cracked. Space Mountain was shut, as was something starring Michael Jackson   so not too sad about that! The Aerosmith ride was working, but lost atmosphere as the sound system had failed. The studio tour was a bit sad: queue over an hour; some of the coaches were defective; the same video we remembered from years ago with Jeremy Irons (seriously?!?) was still being used and, whilst the canyon truck thing is still quite enjoyable, the set from the Reign of Fire felt antiquated and irrelevant; the vehicles supposedly used in films were dirty and rusting away giving the impression we were on a tour of a scrapyard rather than a film set. Long queues for Indiana Jones which was OK when we got to it. The biggest let down was the food. There was a dire shortage of accesible  functioning places to eat. We found ourselves in a desperate crush for fast food served up by hassled staff and which was overpriced, soggy (fries) and stale (burgers)   then there was nowhere to sit and eat it. There were families sitting on a crowded, sticky, unswept floor, children crying, their parents' stress palpable. Awful. Later I joined a queue at an outside concession stand to get hot drinks to sustain us as we queued for a ride. I had to give up after 20 minutes of nothing happening. As for the staff, I got the general impression that, like me, they would rather have been somewhere else: many were clearly doing their best, but I do not take kindly to being barked at for failing to respond immediately to instructions in rapid fire French having waited in a queue for nearly an hour in the cold. I have graded the experience based on the standards we were expecting of Disney, which, in the manner of the elevator in the scary Hotel ride, have plummeted. My advice is to spend the day in Paris instead   see the sights (the Eiffel Tower is genuinely thrilling), ride the water bus, take in a gallery or museum, have a slap up lunch in relaxed surroundings   all for a fraction of the price.

The rides were all like an experience or adventure. With that in mind we decided to spend one day from our European trip at the Paris Disneyland. We arrived by car on time for the opening at 10am. It took some time to get from the car to the entrance however this was ok as they had supplied travelators. As for most places now we had a bag search, then as We had pre purchased tickets we ust joined the gigantic mass of people, no queues, and pushed and shoved until we went through a turnstile. We saved 5 euro per ticket by buying at a local hotel. Cost was about $100. With forethought in Australia we could have saved much more by buying online. As we couldn't access a printer we couldn't do this in Paris. As it was winter the crowds were OK. The rides were generally just amusement park style, not Disney style. The haunted house was pretty good, the Indiana jones just a roller coaster, not anything like the real Disneyland but ok for what it was. The railroad ride was fun. The teacups were fine and the dumbo ride was the same. Star tours was a good ride and the laser ride buzz light year was fine with a fast pass. Aside from that the rides were boring and not very many of them. Many attractions were closed for winter maintenance without any warning of this when purchasing tickets. The food areas were packed with not enough seating, and very expensive food. The stores all sold the same items, as expected overpriced. The store assistants were surly, and on one purchase the man was extremely rude and nasty. I really did not feel as though I was in Disneyland. I saw three characters only all day (outside of the afternoon parade) and they were moving from one venue to somewhere else and refused to stop for children or photos. The only way to see any of the princesses or mickey was to line up for up to an hour.

Which means that the queues for the functioning rides are enormous and the whole process is a tiresome foot dragging obligation rather than a cheerful, happy day out with the kids.

My main issue was smoking in public areas. While this is the cultural norm in France, it is banned in the park with designated smoking areas in place. However, the rule is not enforced at all so expect to have people smoking all over the place which is uncomfortable when you are crowded together in queues or when watching parades. I saw people smoking right in front of other peoples children and cast members who did nothing to enforce the no smoking policy. When I mentioned it to guest relations they told me that they has been instructed not to enforce the policy so as not to upset their majority smoker customer base.

On arrival at the park at 9am after a four hour drive from Calais we thought we would be able to get a breakfast or something decent to eat. Wrong !!! Coffee and muffins were all that was available. We knew it would be busy but didn't expect the crowds we did. A fair few of the larger attractions were broken and out of order. Other rides were up to two hour queuing time. The parks do not cater food outlets for the intake of people. And the choice is stale burgers and fries which is cooked and sat under heat lamps costing 13 euro!!! A small cup of coffee is 2.50 euro. There were a few restaurants but you had to book which we didn't know about. It's really showing signs of wear and tare and old looking. Cracked pavements flaking paint etc. The parades were worth watching. And the only thing you didn't have to que for although the crowds were 10 and more people deep. I made the habit of comparing our visit to one we made to Florida a few years ago. Which to be honest I would say save and go there instead. I was really let down as you expect the whole disney thing to be more magical. The minimal staff that you see floating about are rude and can't be bothered talking to you.

We got there around 9:30 am. You get dropped off right at the gate which is great. Lines were not long at all to buy your ticket on a cold December Saturday. As you've read, the smoking in the park is outta control! Mon Dieu, smoking everywhere, and people are just tossing their butts all over the place. Not the neat and tidy parks you are used to, if you've been to Disneyland Resorts in the states. The other odd thing, is that we could not find working water fountains, not sure if there was a problem that day we went, or if water is intentionally turned off so that you have to purchase drinks. Food and drink in this park is expensive, as it is in other parks, but it's just not very tasty. I saw lots of what I assume were locals just eating their own lunch. Not only is the food expensive, but you would think being in Paris food would be a little better...it's not. We didn't eat at any of the buffets, just got a sandwich on Main Street. No carts selling corn dogs, turkey legs, chowder bowls, or some french specialty like escargo, or croissants here. Maybe buffets are better, but at nearly $35 or $40, they ought to be.

We also visited the resort in Anaheim California in 2012 which was amazing. However we left feeling very disappointed after our most recent visit to Disneyland Paris.The main park now sadly seems very run down and tired, with cutbacks in the number of attractions and shows, with rides regularly breaking down. and the smoking!! I have never seen so many people smoking in a public place, even while standing in queues for rides with small children around, with no staff members enforcing the smoking policy.We always avoid the food outlets in the park which are frankly a rip off. We always take a packed lunch to snack during the day, which usually consists of rolls, croissants and other items from breakfast, and we take our own bottled water. Who wants to spend ages in a queue for junk food and fizzy drinks?We have been spoilt on previous visits with numerous parades throughout the day, including an electrical parade, shows and quality stage performances, Disney characters just wandering around the park to meet and greet you. Now there seems to be one parade a day, no live shows, and Disney characters nowhere to be seen. After about the third day having been on most of the rides we were getting bored! The only real highlight was the Disney Dreams show at the end of the day which was fantastic.The rides are still good, but again with a lack of maintenance they didn't seem as good as before. I compared a video I shot of Pirates of the Caribbean ride back in 2007 to what it was now, and half the animatronics don't seem to work any more, now just static figures. We were stuck on Autopia for some time as one of the cars broke down. We also had fast passes for Buzz Lightyear one day but missed out as it was closed due to a 'technical problem'. More of the popular rides would also benefit from having Fastpass, despite numerous visits I have still never had a chance to go on the Finding Nemo ride, always a ridiculous queue!This is a far cry from the Disney experience you get at Anaheim. That park is almost 60 years old but it feels brand new, the staff are friendly, all rides working (and if they don't work, they are closed down and fixed   not leaving people stranded). queues move quickly, and a strict smoking policy where people actually smoke in the designated areas! on another note, Anaheim has much better Parade etiquette, where people at the front sit down on the pavement, so people behind can see. Unlike Disneyland Paris with everyone standing up and pushing and shoving to get the best view, also plenty of places to sit down. I overheard one Cast Member talk about Disneyland Paris being the 'poor relation' out of all the Disney parks! Have the appropriate Disney authorities actually inspected Paris in recent years? surely there are standards that must be maintained?You expect to go to Disneyland for a magical experience and come away smiling and only feeling sad because the holiday is over. I came away feeling conned, with smelly clothes and a bad cough. cheers Disney.I hear there are plans for an upgrade to DLP in 2017 for the 25th Anniversary, such as a new Star Tours ride. This is welcome news and I hope they also factor in a major cash injection to refurbish the rest of the park and bring back more of the parades and shows.It's a pity they never built the park in Spain which I think was the original plan, it would have been far better I think and and not just because of the better weather.

Food all across the park is the same and awful. you have a choice of pizza, hot dogs, burger or chicken nuggets, all cheaply made and tasteless.Too say the park is expensive is an understatement you just feel your being ripped off. 2 x very small hot drinks and the equivalent of 1 happy meal of chicken nugget and fries was 13 Euros! water, coke all 3 Euro's and bottled not in cups. No characters walking around only in selected spots and then queues of over an hour to have a photo taken (glad I didn't take kids!) The castle display on New years eve was a big let down very poor hardly any fireworks, the display on New years day at 10pm was 100 times better! Bizarre!! I have read some of the other reviews of people who went over new year and I have to agree its sad to say the French have got it soooo wrong! the staff have bad attitudes, grumpy service, smoking and on mobile phones is common across the park.Trying to book a restaurant on New years eve took nearly two hours, passed from pillar to post eventually told after an hour of queuing in two separate locations that I have to call a central number for any restaurant even in the village, then spent 30 minutes hanging on the phone to book a table in the steak restaurant in the village. I was then asked to pay upfront 170 euro's per head for steak and chips in a school dinner hall, Rip Off? I think so, I declined the booking. Overall very disappointing visit, the French have missed the point of Disney having been to Disney land in Florida twice I can judge. Its worlds apart. Personally I would say for what this cost save your money and go to Florida its beyond compare in every way. If you do want to go or have booked here's some tips.Eat in the village 5 6pm no queues, at 7 8pm you will join queues of over a two hour wait out the restaurant into the village. Drinks in the sports bar in the village are reasonably priced for the venue, ie bottle of Frexinet 25 euro'sWrap up warm this time of year especially your feet, no where to warm up and you get cold very quickly standing around in queues for hours on end with no heaters. Wear thermal socks, hats and scarfs and lots of layers. Fill up on breakfast and try to skip lunch in the park its awful and a rip off.If its busy get to park early and find the machines near each ride where you put in your park ticket in and get issued a fast pass to come back later, you can do this once on every ride and may save you queuing for hours on end.

We then thought we would get ahead of things and make our reservation for dinner. When we arrived, the line to make a reservation was SO LONG I thought people were waiting to enter to eat. We skipped it and returned at 7 pm. We waited for 30 min, but no one was seated without a reservation in that time. The line beside us of people WITH reservations barely moved. We tried a second restaurant, but they were fully booked as well. We gave up and went to the  deli  spent too much money on too little food, and looked for a place to sit. There wasn't one.

It pained me to see the amount of cigarette butts and general trash that was not picked up by park operators.Finally, the cost of the meals seemed outrageous. In California or Florida it was a little inflated   it was a captive audience scenario after all   but in Paris it seemed that we couldn't get away with a meal for 4 that ran under 3x what we paid in the US.

1009,247727218,2,2015-1,United Kingdom,"My girlfriend and I visited Disney Land Paris on the 2nd January to celebrate the new year, and to be honest, we were left extremely disappointed and we left to go home a lot earlier than we intended to. So where do I begin      .We arrived at Opera at 8.25am on the morning for the bus to depart at 8.40am. The bus was nowhere to be seen and there were 2 other couples who we did not know also waiting for the bus that did not arrive. So the Shuttle bus was either extremely early and left without us even though we were on time, or did not turn up at all. We then all had to pay more money to get the train to Disney Land (which is a much better idea anyway). When we eventually arrived at the park we were looking for somewhere to eat in the morning but no restaurants were open and the only place that was open for breakfast was for hotel guests only. We then walked around the park and proceeded to try and get food from various vendors   stalls in the park but they were all closed, empty, or out of service. We did find 1 coffee stand in in Discovery Land but the Milk was off and sour so I had to throw it away which was another waste of money. So we did not get food until 11.45am in one of the fast food places at the back of the park opening for lunch time. Starving! A number of rides were also out of order for a while (thunder mountain, Indiana jones, toy story and others) which meant there was not a lot else to choose from for adults in the main park, and since the other rides were out of order for an unknown time it was impossible to get on the other decent rides because the queues were so big! So we did not go on a lot of rides during our time there. We were actually queuing for Toy Story for 20 minutes then an announcement came on saying that it was out of service due to a technical fault, we waited another 10 minutes before we decided to leave because no progress was made, but when we left the queue the lady at the gate then said you can go back the ride is back on but by that time we already lost our place in the queue and it was still another 45 minutes wait. No announcement was made that the ride was back on for the people waiting and we were very annoyed that we wasted so much time. So we moved on. On two separate occasions we queued up to get our picture taken with the Disney Characters in the park, the lines were not that big so we were optimistic. But both times a member of staff told us that no more pictures were allowed to be taken so we didn   t even get a chance to get our picture taken. This would not normally be a huge issue, but on top of everything else it was starting to take the mickey (no pun intended). Due to the number of issues, lack of good service, lack of rides available and general poor quality of rides we left the park at 5pm feel very unsatisfied. We were hoping to use our Express ticket to get the bus home at 8pm (since the 1st one never showed on the time stated) but we could not last another 3 hours in the park after being left frustrated. We had a magnificent time in Paris in general, but I am sad to say Disney was certainly the only low point.

But the magic spell has broken. So have many of the rides   the big attractions   are constantly being closed for  technical reasons . And the parks can no longer take the number of people who seem to still want to go there. And I'm not talking about people like us, who travel from abroad who stay in the 4 star hotels, eat in the top restaurants... no, the parks are now full to breaking point because of the Annual Passport that local people are able to buy. These passports cost less than    200. Use it just 5 times and every visit you make to the park from then on, is free. So we high paying visitors are forced to queue   for rides, restaurants, toilets, even entrance to the park   with local people who are paying nothing. They may just show up on a sunny day and queue for two hours for one ride, and then go home. Because they don't have to stay all day to get their money's worth as it's all free for them. On this our 17th successive year here at Christmas, five of the main attractions broke   including Thunder Mountain   and some visitors weren't told about the breakdowns until they had been queueing for almost an hour. And nobody was ever told when the breakdown might be fixed. Last year, 2013, Thunder Mountain broke while we were on the ride and we had to be escorted out through underground emergency tunnels. And it's not just the parks and rides that are broken. We stay in the 4 star New York Hotel   and on our first morning we were told we couldn't eat breakfast in our usual restaurant and had to be shoved into a noisy diner with no windows, because a business convention was using our regular restaurant privately. It took strong complaint to get that reversed the next day. Then for two nights we tried to book the New York Hotel's Manhattan restaurant for dinner. First night we were told we had to eat at 7.30pm because they were fully booked after that. When we got there it was only half full and never filled up. The second night we were told there was only a table for two left. So we took that and four of our party had room service. When the two of us got to the restaurant, we again found it half empty. When we complained we were told we could invite the rest of our family after all   but it was too late. Room service had already been ordered.In our room in the New York, the two sinks blocked on two occasions, and the toilet blocked on one occasion. Back to the parks, and queues for the restaurants were spilling out into the streets. On our last day our bag full of valuables was stolen from us.

The first two visits were magical and we really looked forward to returning this third time. Our third and what will be our final visit was extremely disappointing. Disneyland Paris has changed, standards have dropped and the magic and sparkle have gone. The place is run down, dated and not well kept or clean. The toilets were attrocious and filthy! The staff in the restaurants are mostly unhelpful and miserable, not what you would expect from Disney. No longer are there any seating areas for the parades, it is all kerbside, with crowds of pushing people, and the regular parades that used to occcur every hour or so have been taken out. There is now just one parade a day. The crowds are a nightmare, they just keep letting more and more people in, park, packing people in like sardines and what seems to be beyond actual capacity, therefore, those of us who pay thousands of pounds to stay there have to battle to get onto the rides with locals who pay a fraction of the price. The newest and one of the best rides Ratatouille had ridiculous queues (about 1 hr 30 mins) and broke down on the first day we tried to get on it. On one ocassion about three rides we tried to go on had broken down and overall I felt for what we were getting Disneyland Paris is overpriced and in desperate need of an overhaul. They also have this new voucher system where one meal a day and afternoon tea are included in the price of your stay. This results in everyone eating in the restaurants causing again, long queues and difficulty getting tables, e.g previously you could book Mickey's Cafe on the same day, now you have to book about 2 days ahead and have to accept a late booking. Auberg de Cendrillon, although expensive, was at least a treat in the past, now due to the voucher system, it is practically impossible to book. Again we had to accept the last lunch booking, which was very late. The characters were aloof and one character just walked off and wouldn't come over to sign my little girl's autograph book! At almost Eur 160 for lunch for three people, I would have expected a little more of a welcome, friendlier characters and better food. The atmosphere there this time around was flat and quite frankly I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. I didn't enjoy anything about this trip to Disneyland Paris and wish I had kept the memories of my last two trips and not gone this last time.

Too many tacky gift shops and too few food outlets that allow you to sit down. All the restaurants have to be prebooked so unless you do this you are left with nasty fast food outlets.I felt very sorry for downhearted people with small children who looked exhausted and fractious. This is not a place for the very young.We caught one brief glimpse of a Disney character in the four days we were there. The philosophy behind this venture seems to be to charge exorbitant prices and then pack people in like cattle. In fact if cattle were treated like this in the UK the RSPCA would be up in arms.I would never visit again or recommend this money making machine that has no respect for its customer base.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Unlike at Disney Land in California the characters are not walking around the park and mingling with visitors. There was a 150 minute wait to meet the princesses and an hour wait to meet Mickey. In the 14 hours that we were in the park we managed to get on just 8 rides. We queued for two rides, only to get to the front of the queue for them to then break down. Other rides had broken down too. The 'parades' were anything but. One consisted of the two princesses from Frozen riding in a carriage. Nothing more. The other was the princesses and some soldiers which passed by in a minute. The Secret Wishes show at the castle however was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We took food in with us and snacked during the day. The prices are astronomical. Coke is 3.19 euro, Pack of crisps 1.99 euro. Restaurants were serving New Year's Eve menus at 229 euro per head. We had to slump for McDonald's in the Disney Village. But I guess you don't really go to Disney for the food. We spent New Year in the Disney Studios. Our ticket included access to both parks but there is no way we could have done both in a day. The entertainment up to New Year was great and the fireworks were superb.I wouldn't rush back to Disney, Had a far better experience in California.

The park was so packed you could barely walk or move. I spent all day in a queue for something. Queue for the toilet, queue for a drink, queue for food and finally rides. Well what a disappointment! There aren't enough in the park to keep kids happy and going all day. They need more smaller rides and bigger ones. Two roller coaster for his sized park is not enough.Some rides you had to wait for over 2 hours. The fast track system doesn't work. You can get one and then another after you use it, But some fast track tickets were for 8.30 at night when it was 11am! Ridiculous. I spent the day smelling people's cigarette smoke. , as did my children. Why can't they have areas for smokers? In three days we seen two Disney characters walking around and you couldn't approach them or have all photo. I did however see the frozen characters and Parade over and over and over and over. Don't they realise not every child likes frozen? They need more characters waking around for photo ops, not one station with yet another queue to wait for a picture. Staff are either very friendly or majorly miserable! Now for the food. Two slices if pizza, two muffins, two drinks and two packets if crisps,    36!!!!! This park is seriously money hungry. Prices are ridiculous. We spent the whole day disappointed, and frustrated. I would never ever return to this place not would I recommend anyone visit. All that hard work saving for a magical trip and we couldn't have been more disappointed! On another disappointing note; we paid   500 for four people for four days. Only to chat to some fellow frustrated park goers and discovered a year ticket for an adult is   139 and a child   39. So we could of paid less and come for 365 days!!!!

It is the staff who inject the  magic  into the Disney experience, without their enthusiasm the magic fades   a bit like Tinkerbell with no pixie dust. The staff in the American parks pull you along on this wave of upbeat happiness which you can't help being affected by   in a good way!! They are so energetic and positive. Then we come to Paris and it is like they have hired security people, not entertainment staff! They were so paranoid about rules and regulations   don't stand there, you can't take a picture there, you're child can't put their foot there, it is closed   why   it just is go elsewhere etc... They got me thinking that there must have been a serious accident in the park for them to be so solid and serious, they had me on edge and I was with two young children. Lots of the attractions were closed, which was fine as it was winter but I felt there were too many people in the park for the amount of things to do, as the queues were ridiculous in the freezing cold and no light entertainment en route! As if!!! The Frozen parade consisted of Elsa and Anna in a horse drawn carriage miming badly to frozen songs   my little one was very disappointed, she thought she would see Olaf! Luckily we had booked Auberge de Cendrillon   the Cinderella restaurant which my two little ones enjoyed and they did chat to and meet the princesses who were lovely. So this was good but very expensive. I will not return to Disneyland Paris as I did not enjoy the  experience  and in my opinion that was down to the unfriendly, unhelpful staff.

We booked a 2 parks 2 days arrangement, which is astronomically expensive, compared to other parks like Europapark in Rust, Germany, or Efteling park in the Netherlands. It was not our first time in Disneyland Paris, we've been at least 3 times before. But I must say that the last trip was for sure the last one for a long time. We felt ripped off in every way: at every attraction there were queues of 45 minutes at least, up to 120 minutes. In two days we were just able to make 9 rides in total. Many of them had constantly technical issues, and were down, so we couln't even use our fastpass (happened twice to us, plus another time we waited nearly an hour at Big Thunder Mountain, then it closed due to technical issues, right before we could ride). Another fastpass ticket went bust because we spent 110 minutes in a queue which was supposed to last  only  70 minutes. So if you like to spend your time standing in the cold, with some drizzling rain, with children who are very disappointed because they can't go on any ride, with completely overprized and overcrowded restaurants, then Disneyland is for you at Christmas time!

Really young Kids were allowed on the ride and no staff member seemed to care about the height restriction. The so called fast tracking was was pointless as you ended up queuing anyway and most were closed by midday, which was a complete joke. People were queuing for up to two hrs to get on a ride. The over crowding was plain to see and was a complete fire and safety issue. Also adults were smoking constantly in the park whether it was in toliets, restaurants and through the park itself, aswell as standing in the queues. Never mind being bad for kids, i ended up coughing and my clothes were stinking of smoke. The non smoking policy is ignored by staff and customers. Many rides aswell had techincal faults which made the queues even longer. Not once did we see staff dressed up as disney characters, no show, nothing. Everyone seemed miserable and stressed. We didnt see one smiling face unless it was a relief to get on a ride and even then it was forced as all the enjoyment had been taking out of it. We had enough and went and complained at the city hall building. We asked for a refund but were told we had to write an email. To make it up to us they give us five rides, and they promised if we went and showed the ' special' ticket to the guy at the exit of each ride then he would get us through without waiting in line.

1050,237708066,1,2014-10,United Kingdom,"WHAT. A. RIP. OFF.My family (two adults, three children) had all been looking forward to visiting Eurodisney and had accepted the 60 euro cost of return travel from the centre of Paris where we had been staying.On arrival, we willingly accepted the 341 euro cost of entry (one park one day) (2 x 73 euros plus 3 x 65 euros).Considering we arrived at 10.30am, and left at 6.30pm, can you guess how many individual rides we managed to accumulate between us? (By 'ride', if all five of us went on Space Mountain, that amounts to 5 rides, however if all five of us walked around the less than thrilling 'Swiss Family Robinson' tree house, that also amounts to 5 rides)Well, in total, over 8 hours, we managed just 33 rides between us i.e. average cost of each ride worked out at more than 10 euros and to be honest, some of those 'rides' should not be considered as such. OK, I grant you that Space Mountain and the Indiana Jones ride (50 minute queue which my daughter (and consequently her mother) could not go on as she was too short by a few cm) were both very good, the ghostly mansion was OK (60 minute queue) and Pirates of the Caribbean (40 minute queue).I accept that there is a 'Fast Pass' option which got us onto Space Mountain in just 8 minutes, however as there are understandably only a limited number of Fast Pass tickets each day, there are only six rides in the whole park where the Fast Pass tickets apply, and as you are only allowed to be in possession of one Fast Pass ticket at any time, this does mean that the majority of your day is still going to be spent in heinously long queues. In fact, by 3pm, the advertised times that you can use any new Fast Pass tickets are too late for the average family that intended to be on their way home by 6.30pm.I accept also that the school holiday is obviously going to be busier, but for Disney to not lower prices to take account of the heinous queues is SCANDALOUS PROFITEERING. In fact, there were FAR more people wandering around than were actually queueing up for rides. And where do they wander to? To the inordinate number of overpriced restaurants, cafes and refreshment stops hosted by bored looking and impolite staff   that's where.I appreciate also that we could have come along in the evening or stayed longer, when there would have been fewer people around, however with youngish children, this isn't really an option.NOTE   we did not see one single picnic area in the whole park   they clearly want you to buy expensive food and drink from their outlets   but some of us (particularly as one of my children is allergic to several foodstuffs) would prefer to bring our own sustenance.Indeed, rather than knocking down some of these outlets and building more rides from the massive profits that they are clearly making, Disney seem to have a lacklustre approach to their hardworking and far less rich customers. Many of the 'attractions' at Eurodisney are tired reproductions of the attractions in the Florida park and should be updated modernised replaced.All in all, I feel like I have been totally ripped off by the whole experience   we spent more than half of our 8 hours there in queues and went on 7 different attractions in total, the only one of which that truly brought smiles all round being Space Mountain.So, Disney, please stop being so bloomin' lazy reaping huge profits and ripping off your customers, and make your 'attractions' attractive again.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Only at EuroDisney. It's never happened at the other Disney parks. FOUR times (that we know of) is a real record.There were long queues for everything, including getting Easy Pass tickets, and Easy Pass entry! Most of the rides had a minimum of a 60 minute wait, even the really short rides for young children, like Peter Pan's Flight and Les Voyages de Pinocchio, which last about 2 minutes. My kids always take part in the Pin Trading program. That has always alleviated the tedium of walking and waiting all day long. But at EuroDisney, you were hard pressed to find anyone wearing their pins on a lanyard. The couple of people we found who were wearing them looked really put off about having to trade! I'm talking about Disney cast members!!! One of them said she would only trade if the pin was part of the same series in her collection! They have completely missed the idea of the Pin Trading program!!! (The idea is that cast members have to trade. Note: if you work at Disney simply don't wear your favourite pins!)It was my daughter's birthday, and I cannot imagine a better way to feel anonymous and un special. We paid for the Mickey Caf   character breakfast and when we sat down, Mickey and all the main characters left!!!

BEWARE. Only the Magic Kingdom was opened early (NOT Disney Studios) and non of the large rides are open..

Being half term we did expect it to be busy but the queues were very long particularly the 'thrill' rides. Although these usually had fast passes you had to wait a long time to use these and for certain rides could only go once eg Ratatouille or wait over 60 minutes to go again. I was particularly disappointed with the princess pavilion my daughter and I queued for 75minutes to see ONE princess. They also forgot to ask if we had met any before so we were put in the line for Cinderella. When I realised that was it, I complained, initially I was told this was my fault but eventually the person at the front realised their mistake and we met Ariel. My daughter was disappointed because Cinderella (who we had met at the Auberge for dinner) had led us to believe that we would see Belle at the Pavilion. I Could not believe you only saw one princess. Having been fortunate enough to have been to Disney in the US when we lined up to see the characters in Epcot there were 5  to see. There were also many more encounters within the parks without the painful wait. We too disliked the number of smokers within the park that had no regard for children non smokers. We took our own food and drink in which did save us some money entry was enough!! We bought popcorn at great expense!Have to agree with comments about the condition we too noted various cars in rides that were not in use and this surely prolonged the wait times. Regarding baby swap  this seems to cater for families of 4 not 5 or more. If the parent who was looking after the baby or child too small for a certain ride then wished a turn they had to chose between the child they travelled with rather than go as a unit like the other parent had before. This led to arguments between the children who were both keen to go again. Did enjoy the fireworks but agree these should be done earlier. We went on Halloween when the park closed at 7pm so they were 20 minutes before and our 5y old could watch which was great. Otherwise they were at 9.40 which is just too late.

My good friend is a self appointed Disney  Freak . She loves everything Disney and said,  I'm glad I went to see it, but I don't ever have to go back nor do I want to.  Here's why (from all of us): 1. They allow smoking in the park. If you're from the US where cigarette smoking is widely banned (and is decreasing overall), this is a huge issue. I'm allergic to smoke and it was everywhere. 2. The park seemed distressed   not in tip top shape. We saw pavers that had grout missing or they were poorly fixed. We saw dead plants & wood rot on some of the buildings. Cigarette butts all over the ground and even trash on the ground. This is very atypical for a Disney Property. The rides were very jumpy jerky (like Peter Pan) and they even stopped several times during the rides. We felt the overall maintenance of the park was lacking. 3. Shops and rides closed at 6pm even when the big light show wasn't going on until 8pm. We saved the Christmas shop at the castle for last and it was closed for the light show when we got there at 6. The ice cream shop on Main St was closed, too. The main tchotchke stores were open, but were terribly crowded because nothing else seemed to be open in the Main St. area. 4. Not all the products for sale   like the plush (stuffed animals) were embossed with the Disney Paris logo. Not a huge deal, but we wanted to purchase some stuffed animals for some of our family. I'm not going to buy a very expensive plush that isn't discernible from a Disney Store plush to bring home. (Could save a ton without the exchange rate, thank you very much!) We ended up bringing home cups and plates for kids...oh well. They were the only reasonable thing to bring home with  Disneyland Paris  on them. 5. Very expensive. The Disneyland hotels were ridiculously overpriced. And with the free bus to the park from other area hotels, not worth it. We stayed at another property and it was fine. 6. Not very clean   restrooms were definitely not as nice as the ones in WDW Orlando. 7. Most of the staff were friendly, but did not encounter the  magical happiness  that is seen at the other parks. 8. Just an observation, but it did affect our overall thoughts: The other guests were rude and would jump in front of you if you gave them the chance. This is more of a cultural thing, but we did notice that people would grab a spot right in front of you to view a parade if there was a 1 2 inch of space. (I'm short and having a 6' tall male stand in front of me when we had found the perfect spot was not fun.) And they didn't seem to care at all. Others would just jump in the lines in front of you. The staff seemed ill equipped or unwilling to deal with it when it happened right in front of them   which was often. We decided to not let it ruin our fun, but it was an interesting observation. I'll take the polite queuing in the US parks. Other complaints I saw on TripAdvisor were the long wait times. We did not encounter this. I'm not sure if we're just used to the wait times at WDW in Orlando, but the longest line was about 20 minutes (and that was for the coasters & Ratatouille in Hollywood Studios). Most of the rides we were able to jump right on. (Visited on a Friday in October.) We did get a Fast Pass for Peter Pan. For some reason, that ride always has the longest wait time. And a positive: The parades and light show were amazing. Very well done and up to the high Disney standards we expected to see. Overall, I'm glad we got to visit. But, none of us have any desire to visit again.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I have been lucky enough to go to all Disney Parks except Tokyo. And this was our 3rd visit to Paris Disney. So I think you can trust my review to be honest. Paris Disney just wasn't magic this time. Why?* It is so over priced   a family of 5 costs a small fortune And when you've spent a small fortune you want some value for your money (which we didn't get)* It is rare to spot any Disney Characters. Over 2 days, apart from the parade, we only saw one character   Minnie. My daughter had to line for ages to meet her. We kept our eyes out for more characters but they weren't around. My poor boys didn't get to meet any of their favourite characters. The characters are in the parades, so I don't know why they cant be in the park at other times.* The staff don't make you feel like you are in a magical place. They are grumpy, rude and look like they don't want to be there. We got yelled at in French a few times when we didn't understand their instructions.*It wasn't peak time, it was mid week and raining on and off when we visited. But the lines were so long for everything. It was like they weren't loading and off loading the rides effectively. Or they just didn't care.* Many of the rides stopped and started throughout the ride ruining the experience. I'm sure this was due to staffing issues as sometimes they only had one person letting people in, checking them and loading. So if there was an issue they would have to pause the ride and deal with it.* Most the rides and multiple lands were shut around 6pm leaving 2 hours before the night show to do nothing much. We deliberately left certain things to do around dinner time and couldn't as they had shut early.* Most the restaurants, snack places etc were shut. Leaving barely anywhere to eat and ruining the atmosphere.*There are no live shows   which we have seen at other parks* For a place full of kids there is so much smoking. No one enforces smoking areas and you need to be prepared to suck in a lot of second hand smoke.What saved the experience was the night time laser firework show. It was absolutely amazing, clever and magical. But you need to get a spot up front early or you will only see snippets of it through a million IPads  Phones and children up on parents shoulders. LOL.So my advice for any Aussies wanting to go to Disney   head over to America for a proper Disney experience.

I had visited previously about a year and a half before. I have to be honest, nothing had changed in a year and a half and nearly all rides looked old and tacky. We all came to an opinion that Disneyland isn't worth taking kids under the age of around 8 years old too. The rides are very old and tacky. Im not sure when it was built but the idea of the aerosmith coaster seems outdated. The Monsters inc door and mike models for posing for photos were missing handles and were grubby and scratched. Armageddon was a movie that was released over a decade ago. Please get with the times. The stunt show has been going on for years now. I think it needs updating. The smaller children's rides are getting old too. We went on them as our friends 3 year old was under a meter or so high so couldn't ride on many of the rides. The anamatronics are outdated and some of them don't work anymore. The park doesn't feel magical. More of a mission. Queuing is a big problem. You queue for everything. Food, toilet, searches, entrance, exit. We also noticed some of the characters costumes looked like knock offs. (Tigger and Piglets fluorescent fur). Food prices are EXTORSIONATE!

Queuing for 40 70 minutes for most rides, when working or fully operational is unacceptable, we waited 30 minutes for one ride, It then broke, we persisted a further 15 minutes then abandoned it. Every ride we went on had one carriage or a similar impediment to being fully operational. Staff whilst generally helpful and bilingual did not use much haste in keeping things moving. Near feral behaviour or parents of very nation, which was the most embarrassing aspect of the whole visit, did not help and queue jumping sneaking past was common place, seeing grown adults run to a ride to beat 2 children to a flying dumbo was shameful. Smoking in the park should also be banned as this was quite problematic for my pregnant wife waiting as we queued for rides dodging herds of heavy smokers crowding around rides, come on Disney, get with the 21st century and consider the Health of kids, smoking parents...unlucky. Even after rides walking to exits I had to dodge parents lighting up as soon as they stepped off. The end of the day saw diversions around the castle due to the fireworks display preparations and finding your way back in the dark was just hoping to follow the crowd and hope they knew the way, direction finding in the dark is almost impossible to the new visitor. We came across two staff indicating with cyalumes initially then no more help. Food provision whilst widespread was generally not suitable for children and again queues were just too long even outside peak times, we ended up at plaza gardens and I can comfortably say in my 46 years of travelling around the world (in the RAF) I can honestly say this was my worst dining experience ever. The international buffet was far from that, it was a mix of food that could not be known till you got in and paid. We expected a jimmy spices type experience, how wrong we were, all you can eat and drink (soft drinks) for    75 for two adults and one child was exorbitant, no other way to put it. Quite why reservations are ever made At this place I will never understand, without one we got in after 30 minutes and the buffet platter menu above the platter providing a key to the food did not match at all. We were shown by a waiter to a table and he swept off crumbs with his hand as we approached, food choice was abysmal and two serveries quickly became one, a cheese board just disappeared and the same feral parents from the rides jumped queues to grab at the fresh serving of chips as others queued to get their measly choices of gristly lamb, over cooked pasta or burnt potato gratin and we like others padded our meals out with salad that was plentiful and fresh but being avoided by most. It must be said most of the parents would have been better advised to tuck into the salads instead of the fatty food whilst the option was right in front of them. A McDonald's may have Been better, fast, known food, fair prices and better service even they do salads too. Drinks top ups were hard to secure and when surly staff could be found to do so it seemed a major inconvenience. Toilet provision for an estimated 400 seat venue amounted to; for gents, one urinal and one cubicle and an Italian man delicately squeezing his spots for some time brazenly delaying the man in front of me getting his children's hands washed after toileting, the ladies had two cubicles and stank heavily of urine and the slippery floor stains were easy to detect their origin, it seems provision of, and cleanliness of, the toilets was a side concern as both were very cramped too. Even the restaurant floors were food debris strewn beyond what could be reasonably expected, thankfully not with urine. Perhaps to be expected with the nature of many of the visitors. A request for dessert spoons...for dessert took 10 minutes to have effect. I am sure that some food outlets at eurodisney provide a fair service but my experience of plaza gardens was abysmal and it is probably not a safe, let alone enjoyable place to eat and any licensing authority reviewing it's suitability needs to assess it incognito, to see what we saw.

There is pretty much no positive points from our trip. The park itself looks dated and run down, many of the rides frequently broke down as did the Fast Pass ticketing system. The rides themselves are extremely dated, perhaps impressive when the park opened by modern standards they are a bit embarrassing. We did our research before we arrived in the park so I was prepared to queue, what I wasn't prepared for was just how much I had to queue and not just for the rides but also to check into our hotel, to get our bags searched, to get into the park, to get food, our entire 4 days felt like we were joining one queue after another. What was really disappointing what while queuing 40 mins to go on a carousel (a ride you sit on for 2 mins) there is absolutely no entertainment to keep the kids amused, also no method to leave the queue to use the toilet (which when you're catering for children standing in line for 40 mins is surely common sense). Also the size of the park is disappointing, we were told it would take days to explore them, however we had seen everything in one day.The hotel we stayed in was Hotel Cheyenne, a cowboy themed hotel. Like the rest of Disneyland is was run down and depressing. The quality of food in the restaurant was terrible and there was a distinct smell of sewage in the 'Saloon bar'. Our hotel room had a dodgy blinking light which we complained numerous times about and was never fixed, so our options were sit in a room with strobe lighting making our already Disney induced migraines even worse or sit in the dark (we chose the latter).The parks were so over crowded and everybody around us looked miserable like they just didn't want to be there.

Perhaps Europeans who haven't visited either of the US Disney Parks don't know the difference, but it was a shock for us. It is in serious need of painting, repair of broken windows, replacement of burned out lights (some areas easily had 25% of the lights burned out, and some parts of the walk back to the parking lot after closing were totally without lights! If it was on purpose to save money or just in need up replacement, I don't know.The majority of the rides had parts that were not functioning. Also, whereas in the US there are usually 3 or more people operating a ride (e.g. Peter Pan), when we went on, the same person that was operating the controls was loading people & checking the safety bar was in place. The girl opening the doors on the Disneyland Railroad train didn't even notice that our 3 year old grandson was holding onto the door, and she almost caused him to be thrown onto the concrete platform when she opened the door. Her  apology  was  I have to move quickly . Apart from the  cast members  in costume, very few of the employees appear to enjoy their job. Very few greeted us with a smile or a  bon jour . Almost all seemed to be overworked, or just disenchanted. Sad for such a magical place. Same deception in restaurants. In general the vast majority of the employees do not appear to enjoy their job. In two separate  Fast Food  places, it took 20 minutes to get coffee, and there was only 4 people in front of me. Staff just kinda take their time, and sometimes don't even seem to know where to find what they're looking for, e.g. opening up several fridge doors each time looking for a bottle of orange juice. At times I wondered if it wasn't done on purpose.If someone at EuroDisney reads this, I would recommend that their HR staff be a bit more serious in their selection process to attempt to employ persons who smile & are friendly, and set up quality controls to ensure their staff remain friendly & efficient.Lastly we were very frustrated that even though we paid the same entry fee, many (most?) of the shows stopped 1 Sept.

The staff were miserable and whilst I don't expect that to give me a smile In Florida the Kids are treated like royalty and made to feel like its the best place on earth...I think the manual was thrown out for this bunch of employees.Next Issue, the food, We visited on Good Friday and yet most places only seemed to have half the number of servers, 30 minutes in a queue just to order your meal then watch 30 cooks fall over themselves for another 25 minutes was laughable. Fast Food it was not....Burgers and chips which took an hour to order and cook!!!Most of the attractions seem dated and tatty, looks like investment in the Park is non existent.We stopped mid afternoon to get some refreshment at one of the restaurants.and my wife was told by some teenager that no pushchairs were allowed and would need to be left outside....so again Putting children 1st was thrown out the window for the common sense that was er, my son is 13 months old ......oh and hes asleep as you can clearly see.....It might be a cultural thing nowadays to leave kids outside a Restaurant why the parents eat inside but i would call it bad parenting. Suffice to say we just ignored her request and found a spot where we were not in anyone's way...But the final nail in the coffin for me... SMOKING. How the hell does Disney even see allowing smoking in its Park's which are aimed at young children as being acceptable. They have smoking zones in the park, but people pay zero attention to them and no one was enforcing it from the Disney staff side.

The magic feeling in WDW Florida is fantastic yet nothing here compares. Rude staff which can be dealt with and rude guests which can't be helped but could be managed better. Rides continuously breaking down or running half empty but with long queues. A couple of examples, we queued for an hour to get a reservation ticket to meet a princess and then had to queue for another hour in our 'reservation' slot to meet one princess. In Florida you join one queue and meet several princesses. We were standing in the Aerosmith rollercoaster queue when CM's walked along asking who speaks French, if you spoke French you were informed the ride had broken down if you didn't you were left standing there. This happened almost first thing every morning of our stay. At the princess lunch three princesses were in the restaurant and after over one and a half hours we met only one with the other two staying in a different part of the restaurant. One very unhappy 9 year old!20 minutes standing at a till whilst the guy worked out what to do with our vouchers to get 3 drinks, 2 cakes and a Magnum. No help from any manager who was completely uninterested.Wait times are not a true representation. Displayed wait time at the Back Lot tour was 15mins we were over an hour missing our Ratatouille fast pass slot. This made it very difficult to plan our day.It took 40 mins to get a fast pass for thunder mountain as 2 machines were not working properly and guests were helping the CM reload one machine with tickets. In hindsight it would have been quicker to join the ride queue, fast it was not! We also witnessed 2 cast members arguing hammer and tong in front of the entire ride queue on dumbos flying elephants. Not very Disney.Such a shame as the rides were fantastic when you did get on them and the parade and fireworks were great, it just feels a bit 'carry on disney' which destroyed the magic for us. Maybe some additional toilet cleaning staff wouldn't go a miss either. Some of the toilets were so filthy we couldn't use them. Tinkerbell needs to sprinkle some fairy dust over DLP!! And a lick of paint wouldn't hurt.I know this shouldn't be compared to WDW Florida but it's very difficult not to. I would say don't let DLP put you off WDW Florida as they are worlds apart.

Not much by way of change in that time. The electronic ticket booths for collection of tickets ordered online didn't work, and so after queuing once already to use it, we were then forced to go and join yet another huge queue to get tickets that we have booked and paid for months in advance. For the price I would have expected the ticket machine at least to work.The biggest disappointment, however, was the attitude of the staff, with some of them struggling to crack a smile. Long gone is the Disney positive sunny attitude, and to be frank the attitude and appearance of some of the staff was appalling. Really sad as this used to be a great resort. On one of the days we visited, we queued for one of the rides only for it to be closed for the day as we were about to board. Safety first is fair enough, but a massive waste of time. The toilets were absolutely rank with many of them not working and the stench was horrendous. The queues at times were completely meaningless as entire families jumped from lane to lane. All just leaves an unsavoury taste behind.If you still fancy going, bring your own food, as the focus is on overpriced junk food. For the same price, we packed a gourmet picnic with change left over.That said on the positive side, the rides we went on were great fun, but all in, I think I would rather have spent the day at Alton Towers.

1103,224573452,1,2014-8,Switzerland,"(this is intended as an open letter to Disney)Dear DisneyAt the beginning of August, I visited Disneyland Paris with my girlfriend and a friend of us. This wasn't the first time, that I've been here. Back in 2005 and around 1997 I visited Paris and Disneyland. In 2003 I was at Disneyland in California and in the year 1995 was the first time I went to Disneyland (California as well). This summer I've also been to Europa Park in Germany, Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the UK and Alton Towers, which is also located in the UK. Besides that I've been various times to Universal Studios, Six Flags and many water parks. Just to give you an idea of how many times I've been to a theme park or similar attraction.What I've seen at the beginning of August, was just one bad experience I would like to forget as fast as possible. I was truly disappointed by what the management has made of Disneyland Paris!First of all, the park is in VERY bad shape in my opinion. There are countless places which need refurbishment. In pictures 1 7 you can see some examples. In picture 6, there is obviously something wrong with the gardening job and the various fences and handrails show, that paint jobs are desperately needed. Steel supports are rusting, everywhere. The floors are cracking open all over the place, inside and outside. Signs are in bad shape too, check out picture 8 (the one with the leg... sorry about that). What could it possibly cost to replace such a sign? It does seem to be ancient. Another example of a sign can be seen in picture 9. People are trying to peel off stickers as souvenirs. Of course this happens everywhere, but things like that need immediate replacement.Picture 10 and 11 give an idea in what condition the studio tour ride is. Image 12 and 13 show the waiting area of one of the newer rides. Some kind of sealing gasket is coming off the ceiling (it would just take a ladder to fix that...) and the lamp that can be seen in the pictures hasn't seen cleaning in ages. There is one picture which shows that refurbishment at a building is being done, which is totally ok... but does it need to be during high season in the middle of summer??Secondly, there are countless closed restaurants. See further attached pictures. I'd say about half of the restaurants and food stations were closed during the day. Mind you, we visited during high season on a Saturday! At some restaurants we got discounts that where valid at specific times in specific restaurants. However, you had to find one that was open.Third and probably the most frustrating issue was the condition of the rides. Have a look at the attached screenshots of the official Disneyland Paris app which contains the ride queue times and statuses. This is just an example of how the app was looking during that day. Space Mountain for instance, was down countless times. Also the latest attraction  Ratatouille  was barely up and running. In one of the pictures you see staff sending people away. If you had equally as much technicians, maybe your rides would be in better shape.In another picture you see an employee  posing  for me after I asked him to take a picture of him in front of a closed ride. One picture shows the empty cart of that same ride which they had to send through for an hour to test things. Fasttrack has been closed at most attractions as well during that day. We couldn't figure out a reason for that, especially since it was for attractions like  Ratatouille .The fourth thing, which was very disappointing is, that the park has been deserted of Mickey, Minnie, Pluto and all the others. We did not see a single character in the park during our 13.5 hours (!) visit to Disneyland Paris! How is something like that possible in Disneyland? Even at Blackpool Pleasure Beach they have Sponge Bob running around and Europa Park is full of various characters!What needs to be said as well, is, that the rides of Disneyland Paris are completely outdated and the newer ones are not enjoyable because of their technical issues. It seems over twenty years ago, there has been given a Disneyland to Europe and it has been kept in it's  original shape  ever since, minus the much needed refurbishment.My impression of Disney and the whole feeling I had about Disneyland has been totally destroyed. The Walt Disney Company should consider of taking away the Disney label from that park and park management should just continue running an amusement park, but this is NOT a Disneyland. It's a disgrace to all that is and especially ever has been, Disney.Last but not least it needs mentioning, that you get all this at a price of    88 whereas for example the Europa Park (which is a far superior experience) costs    41.On the positive side, this has motivated me to go to the United States in 2015 to experience the real Disney again and not this sorry excuse of what this place has become.Kind regardsa loyal Swiss Disney customer",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

If you've been to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando then just forget Disneyland Paris exists. It's like an Alton Towers theme park but in France with 'cast members' who could not care less whether you have a nice time or not. I got shouted at by one cast member and we lost count of the number of cast members who were rude or looked like they were waiting for their shift to finish. The cast members dressed up as characters were good though   they must have earned their wings at the Disney University! Toilets   they were a disgrace every single time, and when you have small children you certainly visit them frequently! Toilet paper on the floor, no paper in the holders, unflushed toilets, wet floors, and even a used sanitary product on one floor   yuck, yuck, yuck! The ladies toilets in the Plaza Gardens restaurant smelt worse than a tower block lift!Smoking   everywhere we went, even in the queues for the rides, there was smokers blowing smoke in our direction and even in our faces, not to mention the cigarettes were held at small child height. Hence why the paths are littered in cigarette ends, add this to people dropping litter and it certainly does not reach the cleanliness we have seen in a lot of other Disney parks.We walked out of the Disneyhotel towards the nearest turnstiles to enquire whether we could enter there or had to walk around to which a young male cast member just looked at us, tutted and said  It says exit up there!  and turned his back. What is wrong with  Sorry Sir, you can't enter here, but if you walk around the corner in that direction they will be able to help you. ??? I was shouted at in the 'glass' shop because I wanted to pay for some rather expensive items but apparently I was at the wrong till, but there was no one at the other till.  You must go there!  the supervisor shouted at me (even though the young man had rung some items on the till) and placed the items back in my hands. The supervisor then started tutting under his breath and saying to the young assistant that people should use the correct till whilst he got his key to void the items on the till. What is wrong with  Very sorry Madam, you cannot use this till, but I will take them over there for you to pay ??? They were lucky I still bought them after I took a deep breath and resisted the urge to place them back down on his counter and walk out!Rides   kept pausing breaking down. In Phantom Manor the ride stopped 6 times   son was fed up! Thunder Mountain   we hardly saw going. Some rides looking dated and not that clean. Character meets   be prepared to queue or pay for it, and even when you do pay for it in the Disneyland park don't expect fab service (Dinner at Auberge du Cendrillon). We started to queue for our daughter to see Rapunzel, after an hour the queue had hardly moved. The cast member managing the queue then informed us that from where we were in the queue we would have a 3 hour wait! What? To meet a girl in a special dress? No way! I then noticed that there were in fact 2 queues, one for wheelchair users which were given priority and the other queue had to just slot in here and there. And as for the Princesses in the Princess Pavilion you had to queue to book a slot to see them and then then queue when turning up at your time slot. We didn't bother!There were fleeting glimpses of Disney magic   daughter's 'Princess for a day' make over was priceless, said daughter getting blown a kiss from Snow White on the Parade, the fabulous Disney Dreams light and firework show, and the waiter we had in the Silver Spur Steakhouse was lovely, very 'Disney' in his chattiness, but if we want some 'Disney magic' in the future we'll go back to America.There was various scaffolding in places, and diggers at the front entrance.

After  rescuing  us we were asked to stay just in front of the opened emergency exit door for unknown reason and we were not not allowed to get out of itAnd finally we were not allowed to get back immediately to the park as the parade was entering the park from this door and we had to wait until the parade is goneWe were planing to watch this parade and we promised our kids for months to see it live but we ended up watching the back of Mickey Mouse This silly incident totally ruined our trip, I was about to cry when my sons kept asking me why they couldn't see Mickey and his friends as we promised.Not only we were subjected to stress but also we missed the parade and even the fast passes we had for other attractions.Actually we filed a complain at your guest relations but they only offered us  balloons  for the kids  to make us feel better .

The same goes for the shops   the same items for sale in almost all of the shops. The excellent tea with the Disney characters has now been eliminated.

The swimming pool has no shallow end for children to play in therefore require to be supervised all the time. We spent 3 days at the parks only managing 3 rides a day due to the time spent waiting in queues and a couple of the main rides being broken down on two of the days we were there. There were no Disney characters walking around or talking to the children, you could only do this if you paid extra for a pics with them and of course were willing to stand in yet another queue. We watched Belle practically sprinting through the park one day with her body guard ignoring everyone including the children and parents running behind her trying to get her attention. The one restaurant the kids liked because it had an indoor play area (Buzz Light year) was closed when we went back a 2nd day, no explanation. The children didn't get to see the magical parade they had seen on youtube because there were so many people there they would have had to sit on a pavement for at least 2 hours to stand any chance.

I can honestly say, that our boys would have more fun at a good swing park, we arrived at 11am and by 3pm had seen everything, we had an Access Pass to get on rides quicker, but our boys were either too young or too small, but apart from that it just didn't excite them. The only time they got excited was when we visited the Disney store on site and they could pick some toys we hadn't seen before, but even these broke within 24hrs and we are currently waiting for Disney to reply to our email of complaint (which by the way has taken us over 3 days just to get the correct email address from them). Honestly, if you want to experience Disney, go to the states, we didn't even see any characters, I spotted one of the Disney Princess characters about 60ft away, but she was desperate to get out of the way, she wasn't even stopping for photos with young girls eager to meet her, parents were running ahead of her to try and get a photo of her as she walked towards them, I could see the disappointment on so many faces...just shocking. We decided to dine at one of the onsite restaurants, which only served fast food, similar to McDonalds really, I bought two chicken sandwich meals and two children's chicken nugget meals, I also bought two Mickey Mouse straws for the boys...it cost 56 euros, we then had to sit and watch some budget dance show which was like watching dancers that weren't quite good enough for BGT.

1120,220598836,1,2014-8,United Kingdom,"I don't really know where to start with my story of Disney land Paris. Their is the fairy tale view that you have the moment you walk in the park, the first thing you see is sleeping beauty's in front of you, your child face lights up, I am afraid it slowly goes down hill from their and you need to hide your, upset and stress from your innocent children. I was crying on the last day as the strain of what I had paid for and the reality finally hit me, it was the worst holiday I had ever had in my life and for   1500 to start with for 3 days 2 nights I am devastated.I will bullet for the problems as much as I can to inform people of the problems, not just my emotional response to the park as this would be my view and not everyone's. People all view things differently, what one finds except able the other may not, which is why I will list factual problems and some of the pros.PROSDisney express luggage is fantastic, you can not cope with out this. You take your luggage to Disney express at the station and its automatically taken to your hotel for you to pick up as late at 12am at night.Eating in the Plaza gardens restaurant is fantastic and they give you free refills with soft drinks, the only place in the entire park that does.If you reserve book a table at plaza gardens restaurant, you will have a wonderful meal.The rooms at the hotels are clean and spotless and all have a large tv in them (Chyanne has not got coffee or tea but a kettle!!!!! Tea lovers can obtain tea bags and sugar at breakfast but no milk) so if you wanted to stock up for your room, you could if you like it black.Go Full Board at the travel agent, don't buy food their, its 13 euros for a can of coke !!!!!!The Disney dreams show is fantasticThe parade is fantasticCONSThe park has no welcome pack for guests to explain the running of the park and how you must operate in order to have a happy stay.You can go to City Hall for help (Once you know) but its no more help than being given a map, program and being able to book restaurants. Don't even think of complaining or speaking to management, it simply won't work, you won't get past the front desk, they will stare and smile at you in a very patronising way to make you feel that all your complaining about is your fault and not theirs.You must, I REPEAT, you must reserve your lunch and dinner well in advance, so we are talking about on arrival on day one. You simply will not get a seat in the two good restaurants which are Plaza Gardens (Fantasy land) and Restaurant de Stars ( Disney Studios).I advise only ever eating in Plaza Gardens in main street, its the one everyone discovered and the best place to eat in the entire park with your HB and FB vouchers. If your paying for food then eat anywhere.It is a complete lie that the park rides are open 2 hours before for hotel guests and that the park is open till 11pm. This is for advertisement purposes only and to get people to Disney land Paris. The only rides open are 4 in Fantasy land and 3 in Discovery land, every single ride between 8am and 10am are closed, the Disney studios is closed till 10.For those of you who think that their will be Disney characters walking around, this is untrue, this does not happen at all. The little girls can have lunch with a princess for 80 euroes a ticket. The tickets at the princess pavilion for meeting a princess that supposedly you que up to get at 10.30am, are all gone by 12pm. If you want to do this, I would say, have a family member stand in the que at 8.30am, wait for 2 hours for the ticket and then get your appointment fast. Luckily I was told and was first in the que. but at 10.30am the que was 2 hours long. At the pavilion don't expect to meet all the princesses or to know who is going to be their, we had Belle, but Areil was their and we did not get to meet her. Its one or the other, its basically like Santas Groto at Christmas.Sometimes in the day they section a part off in the park and have characters their, so for instance at Alices maze, Alice was their, with a massive que to meet her, poo bear was somewhere else, then their was chip, dale and Eeyore, but its limited time, maybe 20 mins, their are Disney staff guarding them like its a prison and then they simply say, that it, with lots of children waiting with autograph books, then you have lots of sobbing children that are broken hearted. Don't spend out on a Disney autograph book at 12 Euros, you won't get it signed and Disney rake in the cash from all those empty books.One family complained, their daughter saw Rapunzel walking somewhere with the staff, the child ran over to get her autograph and the staff angrily said no. The child was left in tears.My daughter was left in tears waiting for a character to sign her book in the studios, they had roped off a section and they had lilo and stich, the Disney ducks, toys story and Cruella, 20 minutes it was roped off for all those people, the duck was next to my daughter and they refused to sign the book leaving her sobbing.They will close all the rides outside if their is even a slight suspicion of thunder, even though it never came close.The Crushes coaster is totally unsuitable for children under 7, may parents said their children were so traumatised coming off the ride. Most of the rides in the park are closed at 8pm, so even if the park is open the rides are not.Fantasy land is closed at 9pm, which means some rides being closed at 7.30pm due to the wait to close the ride at 8pm to get everyone out of fantasy land by 9pm. Its due to the Disney dreams light show that starts at 11pm, far to late for children.You need to be sat down early for parade. So if it starts at 4.30pm, you need to have a space at 3.40pm and camp out.Most of the staff that are in charge of the characters or the parade around the park, are rude and nasty and make life terrible. They act like prison guards when you can see that their is no issue at all to the safety of the characters as its for kids.No advise as to where maps or programmed are located.This last piece of advice, it sounds rather bizarre and as a childcare professional it went against my beliefs, its essential to get a Disney land 3 wheeled stroller for even 5 and 6 year olds. My daugher could actually not function, we were their 2 nights and 3 days, needed to get up at 6.30am every morning to have breakfast at 7am to get to park for 8am. Our daughter on arrival day was up at 5am, we got a train to Londen, tubes etc. We arrived at Disney at 1.15ish. by the 11pm light show she was asleep on the ground, in the morning we could not even wake her. I said to my husband that we will have to rent a stroller as she can't walk, we did and she spent the entire time in the stroller napping in between rides. We even bought a Disney blanket. It soon becomes apparent that this is a must, all the parents end up doing it, in fact I saw a 9 year old asleep in a stroller and well and truly out of it. The stollers are made of mettle, are basically a huge massive seat, they resemble disabled children's buggy's, but its a total need or your holiday will be ruined. One family did, 5 nights, but did, day one park, day 2 sleep till 12pm, day 2 park, day 3 sleep till 12pm and so on, but of you are their two night and 3 days your children will not even be able to walk after day 1 due to travel exhaustion.The ques are bad, up to 80 minutes for some and only I think 4 rides in the entire park are fast pass.

The most common phrase at Disneyland Paris is  technical difficulties.  Nearly even ride we tried to go on was closed for this reason when we arrived or while we waited online.

Space Mountain was not open when we got there, Buzz Lightyear was closed due to technical difficulties, so was Pirates, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad closed for this reason while we were waiting after returning with our Fast Pass . . . I've never seen anything like this in all my years of visiting Disney World. The staff will give you passes to skip the lines or fast passes if you complain, but this is simply not enough since these rides are likely to have technical difficulties when you come back to skip the line. For those who have not had the pleasure of visiting Disney in the USA, you may not realize how incredible at Disney experience truly can be. Save your money and visit Disney World. At Disney World, the rides run consistently, the employees go out of their way to make your experience magical, the restaurants are better and offer a range of price options and even the souvenirs are better!

1134,216261720,1,missing,United Kingdom,We took our 4 year old and 8 month old to Disneyland Paris at the beginning of July. We expected magic. We didn't get it! We had to wait 40 minutes to check in at the hotel when there were 3 staff on check in and 2 people in front of us is the queue. This was because the check in staff were trying to sell anything and everything.We stayed in the Santa Fe. I have stayed in better Premier Inns. There was no kettle in the room and no cot as requested. I had to telephone reception twice to get these sent to the room and had to wait an hour by which time my 8 month old had fallen asleep on the floor. We had to pay    10 for tea and coffee sachets!The staff at the hotel were a miserable bunch and customer service was definitely not a priority. The childrens indoor play area in the hotel was a glorified cupboard with a small table and chair and was only open when the restaurant was open. The shuttle bus didn't run every 10 minutes and when it arrived everyone pushed and shoved to get on. My son was pushed off the bus at one point and people were stepping over the buggy to get on. The queues inside the parks were ridiculous with some rides having a wait time of over an hour. Queue barging is the norm which we found really irritating. There were no characters walking about and no staff anywhere to offer assistance. The shops all sell the same merchandise and it is all over priced and nothing special.    60 for a fancy dress costume!The food in the restaurants was poor quality and mass produced. The best place we found to eat was The Earl of Sandwich in Disney Village. The rides aren't anything to get too excited about and 3 broke down while we were there. We found that nothing was easy in Disneyland and none of the staff were interested in helping. We had access to the Disneyland Park from 8am as we were staying in the hotel but only a few rides were actually open and we couldn't get into the studio park until 10 when the general public were let in.I would advise anyone thinking about going to disneyland paris to save up and go to Disney in Florida or California.

It is small, compared to the one in California really small. And while I knew that going in, I was still psyched and excited. The disappointment isn't in the size, it's in the substantial lack of rides. Toon Town seems to have a lot, but no where else. The Indiana Jones rides only connection to the movies was in the name of the ride. It's just a roller coaster and doesn't have the fun distractions of following through with the theme. We got a hopper pass so we had admission to Disney Studios part too. That was even less entertaining. For us, 2 adults and a teenager, a hopper pass was just a waste of money.Overall, there are just a few rides and really not worth the price of admission. We spent over 200 euro for the three of us and did all we found interesting in less then 2 1 2 hours. There are a few sit down and be served restaurants, but if you don't make a reservation in advance you won't get in.

OMG did we spend a lot of time in queues. Probably about 90% of our time there was spent in a queue.Pricing, we all need to make a living but really, Disney you are taking the mickey. Everything in Dysneyland Paris is about making money and not just a little but a lot. The hard sell the soft sell , the repetitive sell they've got it all and never ever give up. The only places that offer anywhere near value for money are the places not owned by Disney, Cart D'Or sold some really good value for money ice cream.Food, get with the program, do you guys not watch Jamie Oliver? EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING is fried, if they could deep fry pizza they would, 4 days we were here and by the end of day 2 I was craving apples like a junkie craves his next fix I couldn't stop thinking about vegetables, raw carrot, peaches, celery anything but battery farmed meat product and reprocessed potato starch. Even my son who at the best of time can live off pizza and chips started asking for fresh fruit. Spend a week here living in a Disney hotel and you will have scurvy. Apartheid, segregation, racism whatever you want to call it. It is a very difficult conversation to have. But Disney has forced me to have it. A lot of the things about Disneyland Paris reminded me of the long past age of the wild west, the food the pushy sales the waiting in line. Nothing reminded me of it more than the apparent apartheid. All the menial jobs were being done by people of African origin while all the front of house, customer facing jobs and management jobs by WASPS. Maybe this was Disney trying to keep in the style of the good old US of A 100 years ago but for me it really struck a cord. All in would I go back? NEVER. Did my son like it yes. Would I recommend a friend to take his children there ? NO, sorry Walt but you are stuck in the last century, stick to what you are good at, making great films.Top tip, if you want to meet the Disney characters, go to the disney cafe outside the park, great food and you get to meet all of them without standing in a queue.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

1140,214294619,1,2014-7,Switzerland,"Yes, kids love to go to Disney and love it despite the lines, the junk food and all the other problems that parents face. Our 7 year old son loved it so I am happy for him but hate the way we were treated both before going to Disney and during our time there.Disney seems to purposely discriminate against people according to the country where they live and the language they speak. I am English but live in Switzerland so I can look at either a UK or USA site Disney have set up but I am not allowed to make a booking in English as they only permit UK or USA based credit cards. So we had to look at their German language site for Switzerland which does not offer the same options as for UK Residents. As German is not our main language their Swiss website is more difficult to understand and you have to pay much higher prices than either France or UK. Presumably Disney regards Swiss Residents as Cash Cows that need to be milked as we are so lucky to live in Switzerland. Discrimination against the Swiss! If you live in France you can get even lower prices than UK Residents are offered.Are Disneyland breaking EU rules? I think the EU Commission should investigate them to ensure that they treat every Nationality and Resident of any Country the same. Google and Microsoft have been fined for unfair practices in the EU   the EU Commision should at least investigate such a large Global Player as Disney to make sure they comply with EU law. Hopefully, unlike Amazon and Google they should pay their fair share of taxes in France.Aside from the financial problems Disney does not rate well for the price and quality of its food. It was a relief to leave Disney and eat in a nice local French Restaurant whose standards are way above the junk food Disney offers. We were relived not to have stayed in a Disneyland hotel for this reason and the excessive prices.Lines are also too long at Disney   wait an hour and then you can ride for 10 minutes! Last year we went to Legoland Germany which is the exact opposite to Disney. They also have lots of Visitors but manage everything much better and actually care about their Customers. Disney could learn a lot from them but they only have the mindset of a money making machine that exploits the fantasy they have created in our kids minds.I realize that your kids love Disney and want to go there but prepare for your wallet to be robbed your stomach to be affected by the junk food and the health risk from the dirty toilets.

The park was totally chock a block you could hardly get moving with very arrogant people not caring that you walking with a buggy they just walk right in front of you and push in front.If you are thinking of going here to see the characters then i wouldn't waste your money in the 3 days at park we seen 5 characters standing in parts of the park we managed to get pic and autograph from pluto as queue was short rest of them were to long to wait in especially for a 2 year old if you wanted to see mickey you had to go to a building as he was never walking around the park and the wait time was over and hour. We found that we were able to get on some rides like small world and teacups in fantasyland around 9pm as this was when people were starting to wait at the castle to see the light show at the close of park 11pm which i must admit was the only good thing about the park however again you have very rude people that turn up 5 min before start and squeeze in front and block your view it is deinitly a must see but if staying in disney partner hotels i would suggest just skipping the shuttle bus back and walk instead as bus is manic we stayed at the kyriad and this was only a 25 min walk Disney village.The price of food and juice is extortion i thought we were dear in britian but after being here our prices are nothing.3.19 euro for bottle of juice but if you go to rainforest cafe shop there it is 2.50 euro or 2 for 4 euro.

So we decided to tag a 3 day visit to Disneyland Paris to the end of a 10 day trip to the Dordogne.This was our last opportunity to go during term time as my daughter starts school in Sept so I thought we would take advantage of term time prices   I don't think there is such a thing, or if there is I don't even want to think how much more it would cost.Considering we went in June, the cost of this trip was ridiculous, but I put that aside believing it was going to be a magical experience and it would all be worth it to see the characters and my daughters face when she met a princess. To put it in perspective it cost us significantly more to spend 3 days in self catering accommodation at Disney (Davy Crockett Ranch) than it did for 10 days in the Dordogne. And it doesn't stop there, inside the park the cost of food drink is extortionate, gifts, balloons, etc are all sooo expensive   Face painting was 12 euros! I never imagined it would be cheap and I was glad we had a half board meal plan which included an afternoon snack. The queues for rides weren't too bad but the rides for younger children are pretty poor in my opinion. I got increasingly fed up with being barged and jostled by rude adults and unruly kids. I dread to think what it would be like in school holiday time. By far, the biggest disappointment for us was the lack of characters. Sure, we saw the daily parade twice and that was lovely but its not the same as getting an autograph and your photo taken with a character. We queued for 2.5 hrs to get a ticket for an 'audience with a princess' then queued for approx 1.5 hrs to actually see the princess   which lasted a minute at most. My daughters face was one of awe and she loved meeting Cinderella, even if only for a minute.We then queued for over 2 hrs to meet Micky Mouse   again lasted less than a minute. We saw a queue to meet Rapunzel and I made a decision not to queue any more as it was enormous.The advertising leads you to believe there will be characters galore to have your picture taken with but this was most definitely not the case for us. Maybe we were just incredibly unlucky but we were there for 3 days from early in the morning till gone 9pm (and later one night). The parades were good but make sure you secure a spot an hour before it starts and guard it well!The firework and light show at park closing time was amazing though spoiled by people holding up cameras phones to record it so it was difficult to actually watch.Overall my daughter enjoyed it, but I think she would have been equally happy somewhere like Alton Towers or Drayton Manor which would have cost a fraction of the amount.I sound like a right tight fisted moaner   I'm really not. I've just had my magical rose tinted Disney glasses shattered and I feel quite sad that it wasn't more memorable for my daughter.

We booked tickets online in advance (an absolute necessity to prevent queuing) and arrived on a Saturday by RER. Honestly I wanted to like the experience but from the moment we arrived it was very clear that this was a retail experienced we had paid 55 euros each to enjoy! Upon clearing the gates you arrive in a town square which is really code for shopping centre. There was many stores, but most sold the same low quality, over priced goods. We found the prices very similar to Canadian prices but in Euros. For example we bought a mug that would have been $12 in the Disney store for 12 euros. We asked for a box and protective packaging which could not be provided. Based on reviews of friends and family who have visited other Disney sites I was expecting to be wowed by the cleanliness and efficiency of the operation. This was not the case. The park seemed rundown and dirty. The bathrooms were filthy and stank.I was also looking forward to some of Disney's famous guest experience provided by Crew Members. This was not in evidence. In fact, there were very few staff members that were not working retail or operating the rides. There really was not much on offer unless you were interested in rides. We did see a parade which was very manufactured, not very well choreographed and frankly uninspired. Food selections were not appealing and overpriced. We went on two rides (one line moved quickly the other one was slow) and did a lot of walking around.

We did most of the things we wanted to do and we're out in about 8 hours, where we had stayed much longer in the other park.Having visited LA twice now, the contrast is quite different to me, primarily the dirt and rubbish around the Paris version. Cobwebs everywhere, rubbish in every pool and pond and blowing around the park was terrible. Even the ducks had to swim around ice cream wrappers in the streams.Organisation seemed quite a lot worse and the Main Street parade of 8 or 9 cars and characters was very poor in contrast. The drivers of the cars seemed as though they'd just been told they were out if a job due to the long faces borne by most of them, only one seemed to be happy and enjoying the singalong with the music.Rides were okay but queues ranged from very light (Pirates of the Caribbean) of about 10 minutes wait to 45 minutes (and broken down twice) for turtle roller coaster was beyond belief. Maybe we were lucky on so e but the vast majority were long slow moving queues.In contrast to LA, the constant threat of having a pickpocket steal your valuables and seeing guards outside the perimeter with machine guns does not make you feel at ease, the security staff inside the park may as well not exist for all the use they are and the numbers (in uniform at least) was ridiculous for the number of people in the park should something serious occur.Finding toilets was also a difficulty as there seems to be few of them and spaced badly (maybe I didn't find them all) but markings on maps provided left much to be desired.Sadly, I won't be spending anymore time or money visiting this park as it is dirty, dusty, rubbish everywhere you look and to try and find something to eat and drink was an absolute chore as most stalls were shut, even inside the gift stores at least half of the registers were also closed.Would I recommend Euro Disney?

Not commercial in the  let's go to the Christmas markets in Germany  commercial. But in your face commercial where you cannot walk 5 steps without a food, drink or plastic toy purchasing opportunity. It was too much. Overwhelmed, we spent a fortune and single handedly boosted the exports of China.It's crowded.

The restaurants are also crowded and loud (even the higher end ones feel like a Denny's due to the constant churn of people) and staggeringly expensive. We made the mistake of eating in one of the park restaurants on the first night. The second and third night we ventured outside of the park into nearby villages and ate locally and superbly.Rides are hit or miss.

All package holidays offer the same insurance option! When I said that I did not like her tone and that I wanted her to hang up so that I could leave a feedback, she just cut me off. I called back again and asked to speak to the manager in charge. Finally a man named Randy came online. When I explained what had happened, he simply said thank you and did not even offer to help me with my reservation.

There is no happiness in the staff. There are few smiles and no one wishes you a good day. The people on the gate frown at you or ignore you when you enter. I speak a good amount of French and I asked if I needed a stamp to re enter (At the gate where the stamps were supposed to be given out!) and they ignored me. The staff in the merchandise shops hardly spoke. Another thing I find amazing is that the food is so average   It's Paris for goodness sake. I don't want to eat doughnuts that look half stale. They don't bother to hide works when they are redoing something. There are no picture covered hoardings here   just brown material. So, if you are visiting Paris Disney and you haven't been to Tokyo, Hong Kong or the American Parks and you wonder what the fuss is about, please please please don't take this park as being indicative of the magic you will find elsewhere   a magic that is most often created by the enthusiastic and helpful staff you will meet in the other parks, who often love (and are as fanatical about) Disney as much as I do!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

To see Mickey Mouse we had to queue for over an hour and to see a princess even though we had a ticket for 3.45 we still had to queue and didn't see a princess until 5pm. The rides weren't any better and the minimum we queued was 30 minutes and why you have to queue to go on the galloping horses I don't know... it doesn't happen at a fair. Pushchairs aren't allowed in the queues so poor parents were having to hold sleeping children in their arms. Too many people are let in and there are not enough characters! When I visited about 10 years ago many of the characters were walking around and the children could see them close up... Disney is obviously cutting costs.

1159,208164515,2,2014-5,Australia,"Having experienced   and enjoyed   the original Disneyland in Anaheim (and Disney's California Adventure), we decided to add three days onto our European holiday to take our three young children (age 7, 7 and 9) to Disneyland Paris: we now wish we hadn't.It's not that it's terrible   it isn't   it just isn't as Disney would have you believe. The most disappointing aspect was the staff ('cast members'). Where in LA you get the perky, bubbly friendly service   from everyone   that you expect, at Disneyland Paris it felt as if the cast members were there under duress and would rather be somewhere else. There was no sparkle in the eye, no 'going that extra mile'   in fact, most of them were unhelpful at best, or downright rude at worst. Whether we were queuing to get a crepe or for a ride, the cast member we were finally met by rarely managed a smile   even our kids noticed. You can't pitch yourself as 'the happiest place on earth', then have your whole team getting around like the cast of Les Miserable.All the rides we went on were the usual Disney standard   clever animatronics, enchanting, fun etc. No complaints there: except for the ones that regularly stopped in motion   the Buzz Lightyear ride stopped six times while we were on it (that's six times during one ride!). We understand that big parks like this have long queues   we were prepared to wait   but when you saw half empty wagons being sent off, because the cast members weren't doing their jobs to fill the empty seats   it became infuriating. Frankly, the whole place felt mismanaged.Perhaps it was not yet peak tourist season (we went in late May), but to see so many restaurants and food outlets closed made the place look like it was abandoned in part (Frontierland and parts of Adventureland in particular). This, of course, meant the queues at the operating food outlets extended for miles.By the end of our first day, we were so frustrated, we just wanted someone from Disney head office to sweep in and sort the place out: refocus and cheer up the staff; improve the food; and add a lick or two of paint to the numerous scrappy and scummy areas that looked like they haven't had a polish since the park opened over twenty years ago.While our LA experience will be held in our minds forever, we feel so let down that our children's first Disney experience was this half hearted reproduction in France.It's a pity   with a bit of energy and focus, this could easily be as magic a kingdom as the American version (I'm Australian, by the way, so I'm not blowing the American trumpet lightly!).",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Few ever cracked a smile or said hello in the three days we (me, husband and 3 kids aged 9,7 and 7) where there  they need to pick up their game. The park is lovely to look at and the rides are much the same as the other Disney parks of course, but the magic is definitely missing. Almost every ride we went on broke down at some point and the queues were crazy, much longer than they ought to be mainly due to staff not loading boats cars properly and letting some go a quarter full   ridiculous and frustrating. Meeting the characters at the park is almost impossible, unless you organise yourself with military precision   which I suggest you do. Find out where the characters are going to be and map put your day accordingly. The biggest disappointment was meeting a Princess at the Princess pavilion. You must start queuing at around 10am to reserve a spot to see one. After waiting in line for an hour, you'll be given a window of time to go back. That's when they tell you you can't choose a princess and you get who you get which is fine, I guess. When you return for your window   expect to wait in line again for another hour and a half. And what do you get at the end of all that? Two minutes with CInderella (or whoever). She says hello, poses for a photo and that's it! 2 minutes!! You get longer with the characters at dinner in the Disneyland Hotel. Also NO FROZEN PRINCESSES! The biggest grossing Disney movie of all time that has every little girl I know wanting to be Elsa or Anna  but neither of them is in sight. There's a Frozen float in the parade   so they have the actors and the costumes  how hard could it be to wheel them out??!! This is a major stuff up on Disneyland's part. Frozen merchandise was also hard to find, with desperate mums seen searching high and low in vain for an Elsa costume or an Olaf or Sven plush toy The saving graces  the parade (always a winner) and the light show fireworks   but expect to stay up late, it doesn't start until 11pm. The food is extremely average, like most theme park food, and the queues for even a coffee or water or outrageous. Staff are slow and inefficient.

Queues around the park are usually well managed, with excellent signage telling you how long the wait is. Not at the Princess Pavilion. Poorly signed, it turns out you have to queue to get a ticket to see one princess, and if you aren't there to queue between 10.30 and 11am, forget it, all tickets for the whole day are gone. Then you come back at your timeslot, go in, only to find yourself in a dark, cold corridor, no staff, nothing for the kids to do, and in another queue for over an hour.

Waiting in a dark corridor for over an hour means you will witness quite a few mini meltdowns, and frankly who can blame them?

When I eventually booked it for my five children I was so excited and looked forward to sharing the experience with them. I saved for two years, read the reviews, noted the tips and meticulously planned what I viewed as 'the holiday of a lifetime' I watched the DVDs of the park experience. I expected magic. I should have lowered my expectations as we were in for disappointment. My children aged 4   15 were looking forward to meeting the Disney characters and purchased autograph books at 10 euro. I advised them to join different queues so they could get a good collection of signatures. Although we were there for 5 days, the children collectively managed 3 autographs; 2 from characters in the hotel lobby and one from Snow White who we queued for 2.5 hours to see. One of these hours was spent queuing during 'extra magic hours' to obtain a ticket to the princess pavilion for an allocated time and a further 1.5 hours to get from the door to the princess at that allocated time. Tip: get the kids to use the toilet before joining any queue and take snacks and water. Despite being at the designated place and time to meet the characters, they were led away each time before my children got the chance to meet them. Seeing my kids disappointed faces each time was heartbreaking. They may have had a chance if they left their manners at home and pushed in front, thrust autograph books at the characters faces or if my husband and I had been as ruthless as other parents who had no qualms about using feet, backpacks and arms to ensure their little prince or princess got priority in the queue. One of my children was knocked down by an adult and another suffered cuts to his face from a backpack. Each time my protests were met with a shrug. I always maintain patience is rewarded and, arriving at the park at 9pm, got a perfect place where everyone had a view of the castle to watch Disney dreams. Again, minutes before it started, we were pushed aside to view the back of heads with light up mouse ears! Queues for popular rides were approx an hour each. Two we queued for were broken. We bought water bottles in the park and, when one was done, my child went to fill it again from the fountain and was told off by staff and sent away. We will not be repeating this experience.

1185,201763391,2,missing,United Kingdom,"We wanted to get away from our whistlestop tour of Paris (art, food, the Eiffel Tower etc) and just get back to some good old American theme park fun for a day. We've been to many theme parks and Disney really does generally excel. At least in attention to detail even if not the rides. For Europeans Paris is a lot easier to get to than, Florida but the experience is far inferior save that it feels much more compact. It's easy to get to from Central Paris. About 40 minutes on the RER for    7.50 and you're there. We didn't buy tickets in advance but bought two park one day passes from the movie park where there was no line and few people at 10am. (Looked busier in the main park). Our youngest was 10 and we visited on the first weekend in April.You can buy advance tickets (eg at FNAC stores in Paris) It all feels so small compared to America! But that on the other hand means you can do it all in a (busy and planned) day assuming your kids aren't too young and have some stamina. On the other hand the crowds must be horrific at peak times. There seem to be a lot of locals with annual passes. We started at the movie park and knocked off all the main rides and the Armageddon show by 1. But really   Armageddon!! This movie was consigned to cable reruns long before our kids were born so the branding was irrelevant. The show though was pretty good. Quick 5 minute walk over to the main park where a parade was in full swing. Then the usual Disney Fastpass games of trying to not line up for too long at the big attractions. Space Mountain was excellent and then regular disney stuff was up to par. Pirates of the Caribbean fun, it's a small world world as expected and the kids really had fun in the Alice in Wonderland Maze even though they initially thought it was for the little kids. Star Tours   the Star Wars ride was very dated; dated rides are fine for the classics (like Pinnochio which had a very short line when we visited) bit disappointing for other attractions which depend more on technology than cuteness. Unfortunately two of the main rides were closed. Indiana Jones and the Crush Coaster. Although mentioned on the website this was disappointing so always best to check. Disney should really plan their maintenance better to avoid two major rides being out. Mixed experiences with the staff. Very friendly usually but in a few cases were unable to give clear directions in English and seemed like they were doing us a favour. Really not like America!Food was comparable in price to Paris. We brought our own lunch to avoid the fast food. Tickets were expensive. Even with a discount. The reality is that if you or your kids are Disney fans this is good fun. If you're not hooked on Disney the premium payable for the Disney factor is debatable as many of the rides are disappointing. To be fair both the teenagers and the younger one said they had a great time but they certainly preferred Animal Kingdom and Universal in Orlando and the rides at Alton Towers. By. 7.30 we had done seen all we wanted. Perhaps we were lucky with the crowds. Line times were overstated sometimes (45 minutes for our second Space Mountain ride was only 30 minutes for example) and by late afternoon other than the few large rides, waits were 5 minutes for many of the rides. In summary, unless you're a big Disney fan or have younger kids I'd probably avoid simply due to the cost (unless you're not worried about the money in which case he kids will have fun!). Budget on a mid range 32gb iPad Air for a family of 5 with a picnic lunch, a few drinks and ice creams and a couple of Disney pins. Obviously you can spend a lot more and there are different costings if you stay at the park or buy some sort of package. Poor overall from an adults perspective. Especially on value for money.

My high school dormitory was Burj Al Arab in comparison. Hotel, park itself and rides were all too dirty. Ques all over, including the entrance to the parks. Worst was to be forced to wait in line for almost 60 minutes although we had reservations for the restaurant. In one case, check in staff at the restaurant could not validate our dinner ticket for 40 minutes straight. He called for help from the manager, and he left after 10 minutes to strengthen the agony. In the age of smart phones and fast computers, it is a disgrace for Disney park to keep guests waiting for hourst to check into a restaurant. It is obvious that we have paid for the food months in advance. Why keep waiting because of ignorant staff and managers? If anybody is willing to visit Disneyland Paris, I strongly urge to rethink.

From the time we checked in, to the time we left, the entire experience was awful. For specifics on the hotel, check out my review on the Sequoia Lodge here: yelp.com biz sequoia lod   As for the park itself, it was very poorly maintained. There was trash all over the place, rides kept breaking down and the employees were generally unfriendly. We did meet one genuinely friendly fellow in one of the gift shops that was truly delighted that I wanted to trade pins with him and even more delighted when he found out that I'm from Hawaii. But that was the highlight of our entire experience there. Food is another area the park falls flat on its face. You'd expect food at a theme park to be bad, but I wouldn't expect it to be inedible. We had a burger in the park for lunch one day, and its flavor reminded me of the smell of dog food... I took a bite and couldn't eat it anymore. And if you want to eat in one of the overpriced restaurants, you have to make a reservation the day before... for lunch or for dinner! And most of the food services weren't even open despite the enormous crowd. Granted it was November when we went, but if park attendance is that high... The wait for the rides were ridiculous too. Disneyland RR, for example, had only 1 train running. That was it. It was a 45 minute wait between each time the train went around. You'd think they'd run at least 2? Would I ever go back? No. Once was enough for me... Never again with Disneyland Paris.

I've always been impressed by the Disney brand and it's dedication to quality. I'm working outisde the US, and when I got a chance to take a trip I thought I'd include Disneyland Paris. Bad idea. What I found out later is that the Disney Corporation does not own the Disney parks outside the US. They rent the names and some of the attraction names. I haven't been to any of the other non US parks, but this park was alrgely an embarrassment to Walt's name. To begin with, the customer service was lousy. When something bad happens in Walt Disney World, they let you know, they give you an idea what to expect, and they try to make it up to you. In PAris, I was in the next batch getting ready to board a ride when it (apparently) broke. They Left us sitting there. After 20 minutes they came and gestured at us to get off the ride, but still didn't explain, even when we asked whether we should wait to reboard. It was almost forty minutes before someone told us that we should leave the building. To make matters worse, when I reported this to Disneyland Paris, their response was  Customer safety is our top priority. In general, the rides are pale versions of what we have in the states, again with mostly the name only intact. For instance, the Indiana Jones ride in California is a state of the art motion simulator with amazing special effects. The Indiana Jones ride in Paris is a cheap roller coaster with painted flats for scenery.Overall, this park is the equivalent of the cheaper theme parks in the US.

Very expensive to get there on the train, then very very expensive to get in so already feeling a bit negative, so we went to get some food from the little pizza restaurant in 'fantasyland.' The food was horrible. It was over cooked and tasted awful, and we paid    25ish for 2 small, rubbery meals. Used some nearby restrooms as well, and these were some of the most disgusting toilets i have ever been in! Had to use multiple toilet seat covers, and when needed again, I just waited to use the much nicer toilets on the train on the way home, and I don't often find train toilets preferable to anywhere!We then decided to queue for some rides, however not once but twice were we suddenly ushered out of queues along with everyone else by grumpy, rude workers who upon questioning revealed that the rides had broken down and our 30 minutes of queuing had been for absolutely nothing. We found ourselves thinking that if they can't manage to keep the rides working in the winter, then why keep the park open and charge extortionate prices? We wasted well over an hour queuing for these 2 rides that we never got to go on, and there was no apology or explanation from the staff unless pressed.

You can buy your tickets from the GREEN kiosk or if, as in our case, they are out of order go to the ticket window. Buy tickets   ours cost about 12 euros each rt   then go to the lower track and follow the well marked signs for the Park. The train was clean and we saw several passengers that were going to the Park as well but mostly it was just the everyday person going about their business. Trip takes about 45 minutes. The train arrives at the Station and as you exit the Park is right there so no lengthy hikes to reach.There is a sort of Disney Village with a Hard Rock Restaurant , shops etc on the left as enter. The main entrance is underneath one 'wing' of the Hotel. No line paid 84 euro each for one park ticket. Enter directly onto Main Street. Basically the same deco but was outfitted for Christmas with a huge tree nicely decorated. Shops on both sides. It also  snows  as intervals! We went into a cafe there for something warm to drink. Pretty adverage and bit expensive. Hot cold beverages, pastries etc. Then there was a Parade of sorts. Sadly, it was pretty bad and that was the only time we ever saw any themed characters at all. Not one roaming about the Park at all.Then we went to FrontierLand where the Haunted Mansion is located as well as Mark Twain River boat and I guess Big Thunder Mountain. Something was smelling wonderful    .. We went on the Haunted Mansion ride with zero wait time. The usual with some  French  Touches here and there and the Guide was very nice. That smell? Barbecue from the only restaurant open in that section. We read the menu: Buffalo Burger platter with salad, french fries and a drink totaled $40.00 American. Really. Needless to say we skipped.Next was Adventureland. Closed. All of it. Rides, attractions. Only things open were something akin to Tom Sawyer's Island and Indian Jones Ride. WE then headed to Pirates of the Caribbean which was open. It's designed more like a Fort in Port Royale and not in any way like the Park in California. I have not seen Florida so cannot comment about that one. Ride is basically the same with a few things added to make it more  French. FantseyLand next. The thing one has to remember is that the size is much SMALLER here that in Ca or Florida! Hunger drove us and the only thing open was a restaurant so in we went. Really bad. A cheeseburger, fries, drink and small ice cream was 12 euros each. It came cold but management provides a microwave in which to re heat. How thoughtful! Mostly full of families with cold and tired kids and parents' longing to go home.Next was the section like Space Mountain. Nothing to be thrilled there at all.The second and last Parade of the day begins at 5:30 or so and start to the left of Sleeping Beauty's Castle. This one featured 5 7 floats with Themed Characters both on them and walking. Best of the two. The Park closed this section at 7 as they have a fireworks show. We did not stay.Made our way back to Main Street did some shopping in too crowed last minuted packed stores before we left and took the train back into Paris. The Park itself is in need of A LOT of cosmetic work. Seriously.I'm glad we went because now it's out of my system and I can say to anyone that wants to gush about how they just 'have to go  Please, rethink!

I've also been to Disneyland California several times, and overall really enjoy the Disney experience. But now living in Paris and having visiting Disneyland Paris twice, I unfortunately have to say that Disneyland Paris is a pale imitation of the  real  Disney experience. The parks are far smaller, the decorations (we went at Halloween and Christmas) are FAR less impressive, the employees are less friendly, the bathrooms are much more disgusting, the park dirtier, the food is even more overpriced and FAR worse, and it just doesn't feel near as magical or fun. The general visitor population is much ruder, and I swear the park is about half as lit so you can't see where you're going. It doesn't help that most people ignore the no smoking regulations and you even have people chain smoking while waiting in lines and for parades next to you. There are some benefits to visiting though for the die hard Disney amusement park fans since many of the rides are quite different (Space Mountain and India Jones are incredibly different and much more exciting) and the Haunted Mansion is far more creepier than the US versions. And we didn't hate our time there (hence the two circles instead of one). But unless you're a hardcore Disney nut, it's really not worth the cost to go out there and pay for a very substandard Disney experience. I guess if you're only other option was paying for a trans atlantic flight it might be worth going to Disneyland Paris, but really, save your money and go to Orlando.

My grandson had one ambition  to meet Lightening McQueen  and my daughter wanted the whole experience, most particularly to see a 'real' Disney Castle for the first time and to see the fake snow on main street. As she is the eldest of several siblings we had never felt able to justify the cost of a Disneyland trip against the potential benefits while she was growing up. How right we were.Our first experience was an argument with the uniformly rude, arrogant and supremely unhelpful staff. The travel agent had booked the trip when my grandson was two, and had not noted that he would be three for two of the four days of the trip. My daughter was told that she would have to pay on the basis of him being three for these two days, and unless we produced a credit card, now, we could not be admitted. The debate went on for an hour and involved us having to contact the travel agent in England on my phone. Painstakingly, the staff began to move towards the understanding that this was an issue between the park and the travel agent and that the customers should be admitted without extra payment. This was however only after I handbagged two receptionists in my bad grandma French, having dealt with my grandson watching a stream of children skipping past him, and his ongoing questions about when he would be allowed in to see Lightening McQueen. The staff's English was apparently poor, but when confronted with a bolshy grandma loudly asserting 'il est fatigue' 'l'enfant faut manger, il est un petit garcon' alongside the ministrations of the English travel agent, they began to move.... slowly. The fact that a tired, hungry little boy just wanted to see his cartoon hero did not seem to make any impression upon them at all. This set the tone for the holiday.The staff on the park are, in general, rude and unhelpful, bringing a new dimension to the term 'jobsworth'. If you speak to them in English they indicate that they don't understand you; if you then speak back to them in French, they reply in English, presumably because their attempt not to deal with you is clearly not going to work. My daughter, my son in law and grandson waited in line for quite some time so grandson could have his photograph taken with Mickey Mouse. When they got to the front of the queue, Mickey looked at his watch and then informed them in French that it was his time to leave, so no photo. When they protested they were told 'fini, you go 'ome'. They also waited in line to get my grandson's face painted. When they got there they were first of all told that they did not do bespoke requests (he wanted to be a spider, not an off the card Disney character), and then when the staff found out he was not yet three (his birthday was the following day) they said they wouldn't do it at all because under threes were not paying customers. Unfortunately, Grandma was not there with her bad French and handbag (the grandparents went to Paris on the train that day), so he never got the photo or the face paint. The food is expensive and extremely poor quality; finding unprocessed vegetable matter in the day to day offering was extremely rare. We were charged nearly   10 for one very ordinary giant hotdog; two burger bar quality chicken nuggets and chips portions were   35 euros. There is a garage at the entrance to the hotel we stayed in (Santa Fe), to which a steady stream of guests with carrier bags walked backwards and forwards. A packet of crisps that was 3 euros on the park was just over 1 euro in the garage, for example. Obviously, the choice of food was pretty limited in the garage (similar to what one would find in an English garage shop) so this was only a partial solution. For a main meal, the standard fare in both the Santa Fe and Cheyenne was an all you can eat buffet for 23.50 euros a head with only very poor, synthetic food available (e.g., pizza, chips, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, a range of sugary desserts such as doughnuts etc). As diabetics, a lot of what was on offer was unsuitable for the grandparents; even the pizza tasted sweet, and gave me all the physical symptoms of having eaten something very sugary. We don't usually tick the 'special diet' boxes; as lightly medicated type 2s we had never been in any 'catered' situation where we have failed to find a range of things we can safely eat .... except last week, in Disneyland Paris.Guests in the Disney hotels are allowed into the park at 8am, two hours before the general 10am opening, but do make sure you go to the toilet first, as you can't bank on them being open. We found only one ladies open, with the gents next to it padlocked, for e.g. Also, other grandmas out there, don't expect to be able to get a cup of tea while the offspring go on the rides as the cafes on the park are also closed until the general opening time. In fact, don't expect to be able to get a cup of tea anywhere  the choice at meal times in the hotel is coffee, hot chocolate, orange juice, milk or water, and there are no tea  coffee making facilities available in the rooms. The only place we found we could get a decent cup of tea was Starbucks in Paris! There is a Starbucks just outside the Disney park (alongside some other international fast food chain restaurants), but the prices on this strip still appeared to be inflated to a similar level that is found on the park itself. The best I can say about the experience is that the rooms were meticulously cleaned everyday and maintained to a high standard, and, as small children will, my grandson did still find magic in sleeping in a Lightening McQueen decorated room, going on the rides that were suitable for him (and, take note, those with under 7s, there are not huge amounts of these, although we had expected this) and seeing the 'Cars' show, with Lightening as the star turn. However as far as grandma is concerned, the whole experience has certainly dispelled any magic Disney ever held for me. Sorry Uncle Walt, even though when I was not much older than my grandson is now, I viewed the Disney castle icon as a delicious promise that a film or TV programme was going to be really good, as far as I am concerned, you not only ripped me off, but also my daughter and my three year old grandson, and I really, really don't like you anymore. Your 'magic kingdom' was not so much 'wishing upon a star so dreams come true' as 'the nightmare before Christmas' for me.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The kids got to meet the characters in the hotel lounge, without having queue for hours (we were up very early though)We didn't get robbed this time we stayed at the the New York Disney!Negatives, the room safe was too small to take an iPad, so had to carry them about all day, as last time we stayed there our room was ransacked! So make sure you carry your valuables if you stay there!! The room was extremely dated and stale, obviously hasn't been redecorated since the building opened back in 1992! Room service menu is extremely limited, ok if you like pizza or curried bread sandwiches??

Watch out for rude locals pushing anything and anyone out of the way to get on rides, my 5 year old son experienced this treatment! It seems the park has gone downhill since our last experience 3 years ago at the same time of year revisiting! They have sacrificed a lot by cutting back on main attraction that people wish to experience on their visit to Disneyland! There were next to no characters in the park, the ones that were there you had to queue ages for! The ice rink had no ice and instead were giving out roller blades and in my opinion that is not the making of a winter wonderland that was described with ice skating!!! The high chaparral theatre ice skating show we have seen for the past 7 years seemed to be no longer running or advertised! The restaurants seemed to have staff cutbacks as we soon realised as we had a booking for walts restaurant for 2pm and didn't get seated till 2.40pm!

1239,184474692,2,2013-11,United Kingdom,"This past weekend, myself and four friends visited Disneyland Paris. The following is my letter of complaint that I have had to forward on to the company.Dear Sir Madam,I am writing to complain and bring your attention to a number of issues I experienced whilst in your Disneyland Paris resort this weekend (8th November to 11th November 2013). Me, and all of my party, are huge supporters of The Walt Disney Company. This year alone we have visited the parks in Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, happily spending thousands of pounds and we have never had any problem until this past weekend.Our weekend started at the Davy Crockett Ranch, which was perfect for us and in which we only experienced a couple of minor issues. Firstly, we had been told that our cabin would be decorated for birthday celebrations, however this never materialised. This was quite disappointing when it had been promised by the reception staff. Secondly, our premium plus cabin never included the hairdryer or cleaning kit that is said to be included on your website. When we rang up reception about this they told us we had to collect them from the front desk. After driving to the reception and queuing in a horrific queue, we were then told we needed to pay a deposit for the items (none of us had brought any money to the front desk because this wasn   t explained on the phone) and were turned away. We didn   t have time to get money and queue again since it was eating into our time at the parks, and thus members of our party had to go to the parks in 1 degree Celsius temperatures with damp hair. Over the course of the weekend there were numerous problems within the two parks. Firstly we were extremely disappointed there was no big switch on of the lights for the Christmas Weekend. We had seen advertisements all over the TV in the UK saying that the weekend we had booked was a huge Christmas celebration, and expected more of an event than we got. When we arrived half of the lights and decorations were already up, and so on the Sunday (first day of Christmas) nothing was an impressive surprise as we had seen it over the 2 days prior. We expected a grand switch on of the lights down Main Street USA the Christmas tree, instead of a half finished parade on the Saturday which had the dancers props falling apart and no Christmas lights to accompany it. Furthermore, when we booked our half board meal plan with the stay we were assured we would have a    variety of restaurants    to choose from. This was definitely not the case. There was one full service restaurant available in Walt Disney Studios, and a handful in the Disney Park. Out of all of these barely any were available to eat in past 5pm, so our choices for dinner were extremely limited. It was nothing like the dining plans we had received in the other two parks earlier on this year and was very disappointing. We dined at the Silver Spur Steakhouse on Sunday afternoon (since nowhere was available for dinner) and had, to be quite honest, the most disappointing meal I can recall to date. We made reservations for 3:30pm so we could see the 4:45pm parade. A rude waitress seated us at 3:50pm, and our order was taken at 4pm. It was put through the till at 4:10pm, our soft drinks didn   t come until 4:20pm and our wine didn   t come until 4:25pm. By this point we had almost been in the restaurant an hour and hadn   t even seen our starters, which were cold salads prawn cocktails. We called over our waiter and asked how long the food would be, and asked to speak to the manager. An extremely rude woman named Marlene then came over, and shrugged her shoulders when we asked how long the food would be. She was the most unwelcoming cast member I have ever met. We then said that if she couldn   t tell us how long our food would be we would be leaving, as by this point we had 20 minutes to eat three courses and get into position for the parade. We made a compromise with Marlene that if we stayed for the meal she would reimburse our half board meal vouchers as an apology so we could have a meal on our final day (Monday). After she left, our starters came almost instantly. 3 out of 5 of our party went to see the parade, as it was the only time we would be able to see it, and two of us stayed at the table eating our starters. At 4:45pm our mains were brought over, without our starters being cleared away, without anyone asking how the starters were, when the servers could clearly see that our table was half empty. I explained the situation to him, and asked him to keep the food warm in the kitchen and understood it was our fault if the steak we had ordered would be dry because of this. He rolled his eyes and huffed at us before returning to the kitchen. At this point, we saw that the waiters were discussing our table mere metres away from us, and since one person in our party spoke fluent French, we knew what they were discussing was something to be kept until the cast members were backstage. When our bill arrived at the end of the meal, I asked Marlene what we do about getting our vouchers for the meal the next day. She then shrugged once again, and said that she wasn   t willing to give them to us since we stayed for the meal and    lied    about the date we were leaving. She was extremely rude to us, accused us of being liars when we had told her one member of our party was leaving on the Sunday evening but the other 4 were staying until Monday afternoon, and threatened to call security on us if we didn   t pay the remainder of the bill and leave. We even said we   d provide our hotel booking information to show our departure date but she shook her hand and said she didn   t want to know. I was absolutely disgusted at how we   d been treated by the staff in this restaurant. To avoid confrontation, we paid the monies owed and went to City Hall to file a complaint. While we were there, we got told that Marlene had said we were twenty minutes late to our reservation (when we were five minutes early) and again, accused us of lying about our departure date. Due to this, nothing was resolved at City Hall and another hour of our evening was taken up writing a summary of the event. All weekend the majority of the staff we met were unhappy, unwelcoming and unhelpful     not something you expect when you pay the money you do to Disney to experience the world famous Disney magic. We encountered rude staff when asking to pin trade, throwing pins down on desks and walking away when we gave them pins that they    didn   t want    and barely received any birthday wishes when walking around the park even though 4 of the 5 of us were wearing stickers saying we were celebrating. Very unlike Orlando where you can barely walk 5 metres without a    Happy Birthday Princess!    off someone. There were a distinct lack of characters in the parks for meet and greets, and the ones that were out had very limited times so it made it difficult to fit them in among a busy day. Again, we found this very different to Orlando and California. While we were there, the amount of rides which were closed down due to technical problems was disgusting. To name a few, Tower of Terror wasn   t working on Saturday and half of Sunday, there was no sound on Rock    n    Rollercoaster on Friday or Saturday when we went (which is extremely disappointing when the ride is based on Aerosmith   s music), Crush   s Coaster was down on Saturday and Sunday, Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop was down on Sunday, the Studio Tram Tour was down on Sunday, and had been down on Saturday (even though we understand the Saturday was due to maintenance) and Phantom Manor broke down 3 times while we were on it, making us late to watch Magical Christmas Wishes on Main Street USA. If you look at the above, that is the majority of Walt Disney Studios which was down over the weekend. Since we only had one full day in each of the parks, this was very disappointing. We understand that things happen on rides which are out of the control of the cast members; however we also know that whenever any problems happen in Orlando or Anaheim they are rectified in record time. This was not the case in Paris. Finally, the overall appearance of the park was disappointing. A lot of the areas looked like they could do with a clean (mould on the walls by the travelators into the park, dirty looking signs, trash on the floor in the dark rides etc.) and it didn   t portray the Disney look in the slightest. My experience this weekend was one that I shall not forget in a hurry and I will not be returning to Disneyland Paris until it is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company and is at the standard of the other resorts. This weekend my party and I feel like we visited a theme park, and did not feel as though I visited the Disneyland that I have done many times in the past.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The queuing was horrendous (but is something you have to deal with) aggravated further by several ride malfunctions which meant waiting an hour for nothing. The 'fast pass' queues took as long as the normal queues and to make the situation worse the 'no smoking' rule was not followed or enforced which resulted in standing next to several people smoking and not having anywhere to go! We also made the mistake of eating in a couple of the Disney restaurants (The Steakhouse and Blue Lagoon) and apart from being overpriced and already inclusive of the tip, regardless on how good or bad the service was their special dietary offering was appalling. My wife is a Coeliac suffer and was offered a choice of 3 'microwave' meals (brought out still in there boxes!) as an alternative. It was only after some heated conversation and accommodating staff that we eventually managed to get her something 'freshly' prepared.

The majority of the staff are at best unhelpful and at worst downright rude and arrogant. Many of the rides were out of order or running but with many of the carriages out of service, thereby increasing the waiting time.At Disney World, my family and I were impressed with the high standards of the rides, how clean and smart they all looked, the attention to detail all around the parks. Disneyland Paris does not have this polish: many of the rides had seen better days, with chipped paint, parts not working, murky water etc. We visited Caf   Mickey, one of only 3 places you can get character meals and had a terrible experience. The characters were generally far less visible on the whole around the parks than at Disney world.In short, if you want that Disney magic, head to Disney World.

1250,182917369,1,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We're a family with young children so it seemed like a great idea. But from the moment we arrived at the airport to the bitter end it was endlessly terrible. There is no signage when you get to Charles de Gaulle airport to help you at all. So that was a bad start but we worked it out.When we arrived at the train station, again nothing to explain what to do now, but again with three small children and suitcases we wandered round the multiple bus stops and worked it out.The buses come every 20 minutes, so when ours arrived the huge queue of teenagers piled onto it, leaving us and about 30 other people standing there to await this bus to go all the way to the hotel and come back to get us, we'd been up since 4am to get here and the kids were starting to get very tired etc. But with the prospect of getting to the hotel and back to the park we could cope with it.We finally just jumped in a cab and got to our Hotel, The Magic Circus. I stood with one person in front of me and one person behind the counter for 45 mins waiting to check in. Meanwhile several other disgruntled guests came down to complain that the desk were handing out multiple keys to the same room, including one family who'd had a stranger walk in on his children.By now my kids are going spare and the hotel is doing nothing to speed up the check in process at 3pm in the afternoon. You would think they might have guessed people would arrive around that time.After an hour or so we are checking in and they haven't got my booking, but give me keys to a room and we will 'sort out the issue later'.We get to the room change and head back out to wait for the packed bus to take us back to the park.Upon arrival i head off to buy tickets and am directed to an office where I'm told that it's cheaper to buy annual passports than tickets for all of us for 3 days. I'm also told to buy a certain level of passport otherwise there are 'lock out days' that we won't be able to get in on. So i pay 600 euros for these annual Disney passports for the whole family.They tell me when we head into the park I have to get the passports validated before 6pm. FIne i send the rest of the family off to actually see something in the park whilst i go to get the passports validated.I wait 40 mins in a queue before being told that the whole family must be here to get the passports validated, plus as i have my youngest child in a pram i have to leave him there as we is not allowed up the 2 steps to get to the desk to sort out the passports. It's a health and safety issue.So i have to go and search the park and drag my tired and upset family back to the passport office, queue for another 20 mins before they finally see us, take pictures and validate these Eurodisney passports.Ok so we're finally free to look around the park, we've missed the parade, the kids are in tears, my wife's furious with me because i've been away the whole time...But we decide to make a fresh start of it and go from here.Every ride has at least 60 minute queues, some 90 mins. Even to get a snack or bottle or water we were queueing for 10 to 15 minutes.We've had enough for the day so decide to head home on the horrific bus and go to bed and start again tomorrow. A complete waste of time and money so far.I try to buy the kids an ice cream but the staff treat you with such contempt that i thought i must have been in the wrong area, five people behind the counter chatting to each other whilst i stood in front of them trying to catch their eye, when i asked where i should order the ice cream he just scoffed gave his friend the 'who's this idiot' look and said 'here of course'. We go back to the hotel for some awful food, and to sleep.Day 2, get up and head to the park. Only to be told that the EuroDisney passports we had been sold yesterday for 600 euros were not valid for the rest of our stay as they were Lock Out days.I nearly hit the roof, I found someone who worked there and looked like he actually knew what he was doing. I explained that we had been missold these very expensive EuroPassports and that we just wanted to leave now and get a refund.  No  Disney doesn't do refunds.He called someone on the walky talky and sorted it that we could get into the park. Told us just to go to the entry point and explain, they would then check the files and let us in.We walk over to the ticket point...  It's a lock out day you can't come in  i know it's a lock out day but it's on the system to allow us in  we can't access the system. You'll have to go all the way over to the other side of the park to get someone else to check it By now I was close to tears, the rest of the family way past that point.We trek over to the other side of the park have the whole conversation again with someone else who now checks the files and lets us in.FINALLY WE ARE IN!!But every ride is again 60 to 90 minute waits, to eat at a restaurant you have to book (no one tells you this) even the awful fast food is a 45 minute wait.They have given us a couple of passes to go up through the exit and get straight on a ride. I take the kids on 2 rides, we queue 50 mins for a bad hamburger...and leave.The contempt of the staff, the queues, the borderline inedible food, the terrible atmosphere where people think nothing of yanking your pram out the way to get past, the start to finish nightmare that this holiday was has actually made it hard to write this review.I still get upset when i think of the fact that my family's one holiday of the year was the most appalling experience possible. EuroDisney looks great, but it is the worst holiday you could ever wish upon your worst enemy.Of course not everyone would have this bad a time there, but be warned. This was a very expensive mistake and has ruined the Disney brand for us and our kids.

We got (almost) none of the Disney magic with all of the expense! Now, for the sake of full disclosure, my family visited Disneyland in California in July 2012, so that memory is still very fresh and may have tainted our view of the Paris park. That being said, the Paris park was basically the same price so we expected the same experience!PROS:  The closing light show Fireworks show was AMAZING. Worth staying to watch. We watched it every night we were there, we enjoyed it so much.  The food in the park is not THAT bad or overly priced. About the same quality and cost as the Disney parks in the U.S.  The lines were no worse than expected and most rides did have entertaining waiting areas. Fast Pass was really helpful with the more popular rides. Disney also has a  parent swap  option for parent of small children to take turns waiting in line and then bring a parent pass to the waiting parent so they can ride without waiting in line again. This option was nice when the cast member working the ride actually bothered to fetch us a pass when we asked for it.  Space Mountain 2 is way better than the original. We rode it every day, usually at least twice.CONS:  Disney Details! There were none! The grass was dying, the shrubbery was overgrown, the sidewalks were cracked, the bathrooms were dirty, the rides looked run down, and the staff was RUDE.  Ride maintenance. Rides were breaking down constantly, or closing with no warning. Both the Tower of Terror and the Rockin Roller Coaster broke down on the same day, after we had waited in lines for both of them. Not attempt made by Disney cast members to make up for the hours we spent waiting before the ride broke down, not a fast pass for when the ride was working again, not even a free bottle of water to make up for the inconvenience. The Haunted Mansion also broke down while we were there, as did Space Mountain, and Star Tours, and several other rides in the three days that we were there.  Character meet and greet. My husband used our Magical Hours one morning in the park to wait in line for a pass for our daughter to meet Princesses at the Princess Pavilion. He waited in line for about an hour and forty minutes and we were given a pass to meet ONE PRINCESS. Last summer, we waited nearly an hour for at the Princess Pavilion in California, but our daughter got a meet and greet with THREE princesses and then there were three additional princesses (with their princes) at the end of the pavilion doing group meet and greets! Otherwise, we did not see ANY characters walking around the park or doing meet and greets outside of paid meals, and the few post parade meet and greets were so chaotic, I was actually a little worried for Minnie's life. She was being mobbed by about 100 people with only 2 Disney cast members to control the crowd and no line to speak of at all.   Disney Cast members. Rude is not a strong enough word to describe cast members here. Some were even downright offensive! Not what I came expecting with a Disney experience. There were several instances were the cast member simply refused to do their job, for example, the Disneyland Paris Website advertises the Parent Swap service. All rides were supposed to offer it. Many rides did, no problem. But cast members at several of the rides, especially the ones with longer lines, would tell me or my husband to ask for the pass at the exit and then when we got to the exit, they would tell us we should have gotten the pass at the entrance and then walk away. No effort to remedy this. Also, staff members at the Rocket Cafe went beyond rude and lazy and right into offensive when I pointed out that the food delivered to us was not what we ordered and asked for either the correct order or a refund. The cashier then proceeded to disparage me, and Americans in general, in French to the next customer. Until I informed her that I speak French, then she did not even have the sense of shame to apologize for her behavior.   Ride and attraction closures.

Very intimidating and very rude.The staff ignore all the pushing and shoving in the queues, they have no queue management at all.I gave the park two stars for the park itself and the late night show and even that was a bun fight at night. People shoving and pushing to get a position to see the castle. On the Saturday night, a bunch of French teens were throwing their rubbish at an English couple standing at the front and kept shouting out are you English and even though French staff were standing around the edge, they did nothing. This was the same every evening, as every night there were nearly fights amongst the crowd but staff always turned a blind eye.Six of us went to Disneyland Paris and none of us will go back.

We had been expecting it to the highlight and a once in lifetime experience for our 4 kids and for us adults who had to pay for it. Where to start, whilst we did not pay before hand and thus missed out on various discounts, we did enquire as to what a 3 day 2 park pass would be for 6 and we quoted at the entrance gate approx 750 euros or so. Next day when we went to pay it was close to 800 euros for 2 day 2 park pass. Once we got inside, the several of the most famous rides were out of order with no notice of at the gate, the ones that were running had queues of 1 2 hours (this was off season). The food was a joke in fact it was so expensive for glorified McDonalds meals we had to laugh as we invaribly paid (no food allowed in), think 70 euros for meal for 6.The smaller world (stunt show is excellent) was actually better and I will admit that we enjoyed ourselves there, but the queues, breakdowns and expense mean that it was a real let down overall.

Queues and grumpy staff greeted us on our much anticipated arrival. When it finally opened the queues were unbelievable on everything.. we expected this but NONE of the rides justified the wait time. Some of the rides we took our young children on were laughable at the state of them. We went on a slow boat ride around all the different nursery stories and there was rubbish in the water, paint peeling off and just things that looked like they hadn't been touched in 20 years.Many of the things that make made Disney so magical years ago when I went just don't happen here. None of the characters walk around so you guessed it.. another queue. 1.5 hours to meet Mickey and just over 2 hours to meet a princess. We had to queue to get a ticket to queue again for the Princess! Finally made it to meet her and the photographers camera was busted and didn't work so no souvenir photo just one off mine where the flash played up!So close to 4 hours and we'd met two characters. Some below average overpriced food and a crazy 2 hour queue for thundermountain (don't queue in this if you are claustrophobic) and we were well and truly over the place.Look, I could handle the queues (I expected them) if the park was inviting and clean and had a bit of magic but it was none of these.

Disney, being Disney, was magical, and I will brave lines and weather and fast food at daylight robbery prices to experience the magic again and again. What I did not expect to have to brave in this children's park were clouds upon clouds of second hand smoke. I will not expound upon the magic of Disney   it would have be wonderful sans fumes. But everywhere we went, we were surrounded by smoke   there was no escape. Even coming from Paris, which has more smokers on the streets (and in restaurants) than many other cities in the world, this was indescribable   there were times when I was literally gagging on the smoke and I just could not find reprieve. I had asthma as a child but have not had an attack in over 15 years, but I thought I was going to have one on the day, and I had breathing difficulties for many days after I returned home. If you are planning to bring your young child here   please spare a thought for their health. My heart goes out to the little ones who sit there in their strollers breathing in the smoke unable to complain. The worst is when the whole park settles in front of the castle to wait for Disney Dreams   everyone starts lighting up and the smoke just thickens.

You get some idea of what is to come when you book the tickets online and discover that the Disney definition of an adult is a 12 year old. However, having paid    229 for tickets for 3 adults (my 13 year old being an adult according to Disney) and 1 child (   300 at the gate so if you have to go then definitely book in advance) it came as an unpleasant surprise to be charged an additional    15 for parking. Once inside, the overcharging continues   e.g. almost    3 for a small bottle of coke or water.However, none of this is that unexpected but what we didn't expect were the length of the queues for most of the rides. We queued for 50 minutes to an hour for 2 pretty average rides which once you are on them lasted less than a minute. Some of the queues for the popular rides were 70 minutes. There is a fast pass option but it is of very limited use and we only managed to use it once. We then queued for over 30 minutes for Phantom Manor and then spent another 20 minutes stuck in the lift which traumatised my daughter and ruined the rest of the day as she was reluctant to go on any of the other rides. The operator seemed to have no idea of what was going on and when questioned merely responded with  technical problem . The apology when we were eventually released was very token.I have honestly had much better days out at Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures at a fraction of the cost.

Everywhere you turn, whether eating, or whether waiting for the evening show, people are smoking cigarettes. While waiting for the evening show, one father walked 20 feet away from his own children to smoke so he would not expose them to the noxious fumes...but the site he chose was just upwind of several other families with children. There is supposedly a 'smoking area', but no one uses it, and no one, absolutely no one, is enforcing any rules about smoking.  Other than the constant noxious fumes, the park had its good points and its bad points. Sleeping Beauty's Castle is beautiful, and the dragon in the lair is very good. The evening show was quite good, though much less developed and shorter than shows at the US theme parks.  The staff seem variably committed to providing a nice experience.

1288,175429260,1,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We booked a three night trip to visit Eurodisney with our 4 and 5 year old children. We stayed at the Explorers hotel, which was the perfect place for our family (see the separate review).However, we were bitterly disappointed by the 2 day Eurodisney experience. We arrived on day one around 10.15 and queued to bag check for ten minutes. Little did we realise this would be the shortest queue of the day!As Explorers isn't a Disney hotel, we couldn't take advantage of the earlier opening times, nor were the rides aimed at my children's age group included in the Fastpass scheme.We started by going around the Sleeping Beauty castle at my 4 year old's request. There was no queue. We walked around and it was very pretty and gave good views from the upper floor which enabled us to get our bearings a bit more. As we exited, the ubiquitous gift shop offering princess dresses was situated outside. The price for a Rapunzel princess dress sized for a 5 year old was 70 euros! We then went on the carousel (30 min wait) and then into the Pinnochio ride which was advertised at 20 min ride, getting to the front of the queue in 40 minutes! Half way around the queue, my youngest needed the toilet, so I ducked out the queue, leaving my other half with the other child, and we went to use possibly the dirtiest toilets I have used in a very long time (remember, this was only 11.30) situated around the back of the ride. We were able to rejoin the family in the queue. My children found part of the ride quite scary and my daughter proclaimed that she really hated the ride when we got off!So, keen to get the day back on track, we decided to go into Adventureland to grab lunch. Forgive me for including the following experience, but I think it demonstrates the poor customer service very well:We visited the Cafe Agrabah and arrived just before noon as we wanted to ensure we got there early in case we needed to wait. Already there was a couple with a young child in a pushchair who had already made a reservation. The greeter started by stating that the restaurant was not yet open. We said we would wait. She then said  there are no tables until 2.30 . OK, I said, we will book and come back.  I can't take a booking until noon . I replied,  It's noon now!   Oh , she replied,  Is it?  The other couple said  Is it possible for us to go inside?   We don't open until noon  was the reply.  It's noon now , said the couple.  You need to book as we are fully booked .  We have booked  replied the couple.  For what time?  said the greeter.  Noon , replied the couple.  I will have to check  said the greeter who then disappeared, leaving her colleague, when queried where his colleague was, he just said  I don't work on this desk . Flabbergasted, we left the poor couple waiting to see if they would ever be allowed into the restaurant.We then decided, as clearly a buffet lunch was going to be too difficult, we would just get a snack.So, we called in at the Hakuna Matata fast food joint. There were massive queues and, despite it now being 12.25, it was clear they hadn't started serving lunch!So, we joined the queue to at least pay for the order. There was very limited choice   basically it was glorified chicken nuggets and chips with a salad option for the vegetarians. The children's menu didn't include fries   just the choice between 8 cherry tomatoes in a bag or plain boiled rice. We then waited 15 minutes to actually get our food and wished we hadn't bothered. We ended up paying 38 euros for two adult meals and two children's meals. The content of the adult meal was five 8cm x 4 cm pieces of breaded chicken and a few serrated slices of deep fried potato plus a diet coke, the children's meal was two 8cm x 3cm pieces of breaded chicken (unseasoned) then one child had 8 cherry tomatoes and the other had rice. They also got a yoghurt drink and apple juice. The wrong juice was supplied   we had to correct the order, and the child meal with rice wasn't supplied   so had to be corrected.The inside seating area was filthy and dark. A memorable meal for all the wrong reasons, we ate quickly and left. The competition have  No Worries  with this one. We went up the Swiss family robinson treehouse (queue kept moving so not bad) which gave good views of the park but left with the youngest declaring  This is boring, can we do something good now .We found the Pirate area and were much relieved to discover two little play parks to occupy the children. They then wanted to go on the impressive looking Pirate ship on the water   but it wasn't open to the public!We ventured into the caves and eventually queued up for 45 minutes to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which the children enjoyed (although queuing in the dark was a little frightening for my youngest).Returning to Fantasyland , we joined the mammoth queue on the Dumbo ride. This little cracker took 80 minutes to get onto the 2 minute ride. However, we were kept entertained by a large number of the queuing punters having a row over two women with children elbowing their way through the queue. There was a round of applause when the ride attendant told them to leave without going on the ride. There was a pungent aroma of urine in the queue   we discovered the reason for this later!We followed this with an ice cream   which was absolutely rock hard! I have never seen such over frozen ice cream ever! We wondered if this was simply the booth we had chosen   but we visited another booth the next day and it was the same.We decided to visit the It's a Small World ride, which I had visited in Florida, so knew what to expect. The children loved it and the 20 minute ride wasn't too onerous. We ended our day in Fantasyland to go on the Autopia ride. The queue advertised 45 minutes, but ended up being 65 minutes. Just within sight of the end of the queue, both children needed the toilet, so we had to forego the ride having queued for all that time..... Now we know why the Dumbo ride was pongy   parents didn't dare step out of the queue to take their children to the toilet!The following day, we got there a little earlier   and was greeted by longer queues for the bag check. We started by racing around to the car ride we had failed to make the day before, but found the queue as long as we had left it the day before! We duly queued for an hour and got to go on the two minute ride! We did the Nautilus walkthrough attraction (no queue) and then saw the Captain EO which the grown ups enjoyed but children found a bit scary. We decided to get on the Disney train to go around to Frontierland for lunch   big mistake. We didn't get on the first train, so had to wait for the next one which was being taken from a siding. When it arrived, was covered in soot which got on everyone's clothes and was moving slowly (until a driver got out of the train and sprinkled sand on the tracks to give it traction!) We abandoned our lunch plan, and decided to go to the Disney Studio Park for lunch. We arrived and had decided we would just grab a hot dog. There were three people in front of us in the queue, yet it still took 20 minutes to be served! The kids were complaining about being hungry and when I got to the front of the queue, I was greeted with the news that there were only three hotdogs left! The time was 1.30pm.So, now understanding why other guests in our hotel were smuggling rolls out at breakfast time, we abandoned the queue and found another stand and walked away victorious with four cold hot dogs, two cokes, two juices and two packets of salt and vinegar crisps (no ketchup left!) Another 38 euros...We aimed for Toy story playland as it looked in the guide like it would be more suitable for our children's age group. Sadly, this wasn't the case. We went on the slinky dog ride (30 minute wait) and the Flying Carpet ride (45 minute wait) but the 90 minute wait on the other rides put us off! We then watched the Stars and Cars parade of 14 cars at 4pm. The children, seemingly completely underwhelmed, said  Please can we go back to the hotel now and have a swim!?!  So we left!I had previously been to Disneyland Florida with a friend and her children, but went with an open mind. I was expecting a lot of rides to be unsuitable for the children as they are young and haven't been on rides before. I am used to the concept of the ridiculous queues (although Florida seem to make it more enjoyable). I was not expecting great quality food. I also knew we were unlikely to see the Disneyland Park parade or evening show as they are simply too late for the children (7pm and 10pm respectively). I am not afraid of paying the price for a good service and quality product   however, in my opinion, Eurodisney offers neither. As other reviewers have also noted   Eurodisney completely lacks the Disney magic experience that usually makes it palatable to pay the high prices.

We were a family of 5, my father, mother, teenage sister and 10 year old brother and I. First off, we had rented a car and the great thing was we could pay 15 Euros for parking at the venue for the entire day. However, as we walk towards the Disney attractions we find Army men with large guns and unpleasant faces patrolling the area about 100 meters away from the gates which allow you to go into the Disney Village. I understand that safety is the utmost importance in a place where millions of people gather, however, this park is for children, you're not meant to scare anyone. People are supposed to feel safe, not threatened. They should find a solution to their Army men located in prime areas maybe in a colorful fortress where children might not be frightened by the scene. As we walked into the village, the place seemed beautiful. People laughing, kids running and a wide selection of well known restaurants. We were instantly attracted to eating at Planet Hollywood, having tried it in London and Orlando we were enthusiastic to try it in France too. It was horrible. The lady at the service area was grumpy and pissed off, the food was not anything Planet Hollywood should be proud to sell and the tables were dirty. Everything was so cramped up in the center and it was all an unpleasant experience. After our meal, we decided we to check out the IMAX cinema which featured all the latest movies. My younger brother was so keen on watching 'Lone Ranger' we decided to go. Now to attract more people the French must understand that they must swallow their pride! Every movie was showing in French! I thought it was obnoxious, especially since they need tourists to like what they offer because of the depressed economic situation in France. I've realized that if we didn't know a few words in French they dealt with their customers poorly. It made me wonder what kind of customer service philosophy they have. I've traveled all over the world, and they've made it clear that they're talking to us because they have to if they want to make any business. The queues were outstanding, 75 to 90 minutes of waiting on rides that last about 30 seconds. They lack in organization skills; a place where the most organization is needed. If Disney Paris don't get their act together they could be losing so many more people in the years to follow. All in all, the thing that really discomforted me and really made me regret the experience was the lack of respect the people working their had for their customers. It was absolutely unbelievable. The people in the rides speak with a tone of frustration, the people at counters are absolutely cold and the whole atmosphere is just dull. There were a few moments when we went into the Studios park and the Attraction park where we found happy people to serve us but that was a rarity; and we had bought 3 day tickets so that was a bummer.

The parades were good, not brilliant though and very 'samey' as you'd imagine. The fireworks were amazing. We watched them on the Thursday night and after four days of being pushed and swore at and trampled on and smoked on and rude service and paying through the nose for everything and a crappy hotel (New York), the fireworks almost, but not quite, made me hate Disney a little less.

The people in front didn't bother to sit down to let others in the back see the parades or evening shows fireworks in front of the Castle. No cast members seem to be doing anything. One French guy asked his countrymen politely to sit down but they didn't bother.The only surprise we had was there was no queue for Space Mountain in the evening!Overall, we would rate it only better than Disneyland Hong Kong, which continues to be the bottom of our list of Disney Parks.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

1299,174733777,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"In short, massively disappointing. We spent about 7 hours there today (a Thursday in late august 2013) I would say over 6hrs of it was spent in one queue or another   long queues to get in, for food, the rides, the shows, even to get out. On arrival, was really looking forward to it, my children were bubbling over with excitement. With most of the attractions we took one look at the hundreds of people in the queue and didn't bother. We went on 3 rides all day, which my 2 kids liked whilst they lasted (about 5 mins). Im sorry Disney, but you cannot expect young children to wait around in a queue for an hour. My wife had to queue for over an hour for a few MacDonalds type overpriced cheeseburgers. There really is nowhere to buy food that is decent (I expected inflated food prices so didn't mind that too much). To rub salt in the wounds our 2 day pass cost us Euro404   a huge cost for a very disappointing experience. I would liken it to paying   20 an hour for the privilege of queuing with a mass of humanity   at one point I formed the view that waiting in line with bored, fractitious children at heathrow was better than this, at least at heathrow you weren't paying for it! After the disaster with Disneyland itself, we decided to give the neighbouring Studios a try, with a show. Sold out. We gave up at this point. For my taste, there is not enough in the way of characters walking around, and too much in the way of shops and trying to sell you overpriced tat. As my mind wandered in the day (and my spirits slowly deflated, from optimism, to resignation, to frustration, finally to exhaustion and  get me out of here  claustrophobia) I felt a rising disillusionment with in your face global branding consumerism. Speaking personally, I could not wait to get out of the place (even had to queue for that for half an hour). As my wife said at the end LEGOLAND Windsor was better than that. Summed it up really. The worst of it is, as I write this, I have to go back tomorrow, as we booked a 2 day pass! Urgghhhh! Seriously, I wouldn't bother. Disney, get your act together please   this place is truly awful.

1302,174472820,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"After returning from our holiday I would like to express my concerns about my family's experience.Both parks were both dangerously overpopulated resulting in queue times of over 30 mins for the bag check alone, over an hour for the rides and 30 minute queues for food outlets. I can only imagine the chaos if there was an accident and they needed to be vacated in an emergency.The staff were pretty much non existent and those that were available, gave the impression of being harassed and only able to spare a few seconds.The Disney characters who are apparently available at most times for children to greet are only available for 10 minutes with no forethought given to arrange a line for small children to have a picture taken so a mass scramble by adults ensues so no children get their picture taken, we tried to see 5 x characters in 2 days (Minnie Mouse on 3 occasions) and were unable to get anywhere near them resulting in both of my daughters in tears as this was the main thing that they were looking forward to.We managed to bump into a couple of characters whilst walking around the park and when asked if they could stop for a photo opportunity, my children were gently pushed to one side on both occasions leaving us with some awkward questions as to why the characters are ignoring them!The fast pass option is for a selected number of rides, most of them not being suitable for young children.Overall we are extremely disappointed with our stay, the Disney magic that I promised my children has been ruined, the experience is not as advertised and we will not be returning, nor will we be recommending the trip to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The boys enjoyed the rides immensely although due to time constraints caused by long queues we didn't quite manage to get on all the ones they wanted to.The whole experience was hard work as the park opens at 10am and closes at 11pm, and at this time of year the queues are long for every ride. Expect to walk long distances, and be on your feet a lot. The advertised wait times are consistently over 60 minutes (and occasionally 2 hours !) for most of the popular rides, and we discovered that the advertised times were a guide only as often we had to wait even longer.With hindsight we could have had a more productive visit if we had planned our days out with military precision and used the fast pass system more.The other shock to the system was the price of everything. Over 3 Euro for a bottle of coke and a hot dog costs nearly 7 Euro. We at at a couple of restaurants in Disney Village and it works out at around 35 Euro a head for a main course, dessert plus a soft drink. With a bit of planning you could get stuff cheaper from the supermarket and take it in but technically, you aren't supposed to take picnics in with you and we were on holiday so opted to buy food on site.Stayed at Davy Crocketts ranch which absolutely fine, only about 10 mins away from the DLP site.Overall, we felt the sheer number of people they let into the park really lets it down. It means the queues are allowed to get ridiculously long and the cleanliness of the park suffers (e.g. the toilets are a disgrace). Also be warned that you won't see many characters in the park unless you queue at the designated places, and that despite the no smoking policy, loads of people ignore it and puff away in open spaces and occasionally, in the line for the ride !

1305,174264188,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I visited Disneyland Paris with my family (teenage daughter and 9 year old son) on a stopover visit to Paris last week. I experienced the worst day out at an establishment that is run by people who obviously do not understand the brand they are trying to sell; and that's what it is   a sales trick. At Disneyland Paris I found some (mostly malfunctioning) adventure rides positioned as an enticement to the biggest retail space in Paris. Disneyland Paris is not about fun rides, it's about spending your currency in Disney outlets. The rides don't work   we arrived at a ridiculously crowded park last week and spent the whole day there (10am   11.45pm). Having paid over   200 for tickets to gain admission we queued for 6 different rides during the day; four of which either broke down before we could get on them or broke down while we were on and had to be evacuated. My 9 year old son was evacuated from two of his favourite Disney 'story' rides through backstage areas featuring trash bins and service vehicles   in his words  the magic died  that day and so did my interest in anything to do with Disney. The irony of it all was that while we were sat on broken down rides the PA speakers were pumping out messages about the Disney magical fantasy experience spanning 20 years! The only highlight of the day was the Buffalo Bill Wild West show which I took the .children to in the evening to make up for a ruined day out   costing me another   200 for the show but at least it was worth it   well run and friendly service, good food and some great cowboy action. An enjoyable fantasy.So in conclusion buyer beware; if you want fun adventure rides that work and represent value for the money you pay to get in   then stay well away from Disneyland Paris or run the risk of experiencing a day like ours.

Not one to ever write reviews, I am totally appalled by the lack of so called 'magic' Disney Land Paris has to offer. There is a no smoking policy, however NO ONE adheres to it. You can be stood in a queue 250 people deep full of people smoking, happily puffing smoke into your children's lungs... regardless of the fact that you are outside, DLP stinks of cigarettes! Not to mention armpits... due to the fact that people are expected to wait around for hours on end in the heat queueing for a ride that only lasts between 1 and 2 minutes. Hardly the magical fairy tale land you are led to believe it is!As for the toilets... can they not afford a cleaner? Our first impressions of DLP were the toilets at the entrance and I can honestly say they were filthy and the stench of urine was enough to make you feel sick. So on top of the stench of armpits, urine and cigarettes nearly every ride we attempted to go on was broken. The Rockin Roller Coaster, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates Of The Carribbean.... in fact we got stuck half way through our Pirates Of The Caribbean ride on quite a steep slope in the dark which frightened our girls.... only to be left there for 20 minutes! When we were eventually evacuated from the building via the fire escape! Did we get an apology? Of course not. You will wait for hours for your ride.... and if your little girl wants to see a Princess they no longer just walk around the park... you have to get in line and queue for a couple of hours. Its handwork to say the least, however this was peak season. On positive note the parades are very good as is the light show at the end.Our accommodation was clean, we were a party of 6 so we had to stay in Davey Crocketts Ranch. Ask for a new cabin on arrival if you can, they are much better than the older ones! On arrival the reception staff were a little moody.... not what you would expect from Disney. So all in all Disney's motto is  Do you believe in Magic  my answer is NO! A shocking waste of money! Bring in on the spot smoking fines for all those ignorant smokers polluting the lungs of small children!

There is a lot of stands of food and toys but no information anywhere and indications are not as clear to find your way around. The waiting time to get a meal was inappropriate: 45 minutes standing in a line for a meal of hamburgers with children waiting next to you doesn't make any sense. This was on a week day! Can't they find enough employees to work or are they just all disorganized? Anyway, nobody cared! and then the quality of the food is awful.

The park theming, atmosphere and stage presence are brilliant. It was a good few years since me and the family went to Disneyland Paris, so we were looking forward to the extended 20th year anniversary experience.Facts:1. It is expensive. Don't fool yourself.2. Food   drink in the park and in Disney Village is expensive. You   re in a captive market.3. Merchandise is expensive and in some cases more so than a UK based Disney Store.4. Most staff natively speaks French. Don't expect them to speak English just because you do.5. Extra Magic hours allow guests staying at Disney hotels to enter the Disneyland Park 2 hours before official opening.6. It was unbelievably busy. By mid afternoon the turnstiles showed 67,000 visitors.7. If you enjoy smoking   great it   s just for you. If not YOU WILL GET ANNOYED!This holiday was booked direct via the Disneyland Paris website in January this year (2 adults and 2 children   girls 5 and 9 years old).We took the 2 days extra free offer so opted for the 7 days   6 nights stay on site at the Sequoia Lodge. Park tickets would be provided for the entire stay. Breakfast in the hotel was also included. Flights were booked direct with Flybe from Manchester airport. Shuttle transfer from CDG Paris airport to Disneyland Paris was booked with VEA. We have used private hire buses in the past but wanted the children to enjoy a Disney themed coach amongst other holiday goers.We fully understood that going in the middle of August would mean getting there during the peak season. Having been a few years back around the same time we didn't think anything of it. We booked a really early flight outbound and a late flight return in order to spend as much time as possible in the Parks.The flight with Flybe was excellent. Customer service was brilliant. On landing at Paris CDG we had to be ushered onto a bus which took us on a back stage tour of CDG before stopping at the security check in. This is the norm and didn't cause any delays.On finally exiting the airport the rush was on to find the terminus for the VEA coaches. This is where the first stench of smoke kicks in. Cigs light up all around like Christmas fairy lights. From experience every VEA driver encountered seems to have very little English vocabulary and is never polite. So once we found the bus stop and the coach turned up it became a free for all. Not a nice site for young children. The driver literally gets out, opens up the baggage doors and gets back in his seat. You then fight to stick your cases in the hold area before anyone else. There is no organisation just pure push and shove. You need to tell the driver the name of the hotel you are going toTip:If you get the coach tickets online to print out, take a few copies in case the driver   s scanner can't read the barcode off your tickets.Journey time to Disneyland Paris from CDG with VEA was about 40 minutes. As you approach the hotels the driver will  shout  the name of the hotel as he stops outside the reception area. You need to jump off at your hotel and grab your bags.Sequoia Lodge:Every time we come to Disneyland Paris we have always stayed at Sequoia Lodge. The hotel sits at the side of the lake near Disney Village and is a short 10   15 minute walk to the Parks.We have always found the checking in process easy and the staff really friendly. You are asked to pick your breakfast time slots for your duration of stay. Rooms only become available at 3pm but you can leave your luggage in a special hold area so you can go straight to the parks.Tip:I would advise getting 7 am or 7:30 am time slots as any time after becomes really busy. Also if you want to get the most out of the extra magic hours you need to get to the park early.We went to the parks as it was 10:30am when we arrived at the hotel. More about the parks later.When we came back to the hotel we had to go to reception to retrieve the key cards for our room. You retrieve your luggage and take it back to your room. Rooms are pretty decent. You don   t get a kettle so take a travel one if you need it or hire one from reception.Breakfast at Sequoia can be a bit busy if you go too late. There   s lots of meat, pastries, juices and cereal to choose from. There are two breakfast areas (normally the restaurants in the evening). I would recommend stocking up on the bread rolls, yoghurts and anything else you can stick in a rucksack. Very handy for snacking on round the parks and saves you money. Take a few small bottles so you can top up with juice.Tip:There are lots of free water fountains just outside Disneyland Park and inside. Top up your bottles for free instead of paying extortionate prices for bottled water.After breakfast you have the option of walking to the parks, catching the small car train outside the back of the hotel or catching a regular free Disney bus to the train station outside of the Disney Village. The small train is a rip off at 2 euros a person (return) as it only takes you from the back doors of Sequoia to the security entrance of Disney Village.If you   re not tired then walk to the parks via the village. The Disney buses run every 15 minutes outside the front entrance to the hotel and they are free. The only problem is they drop you off at the bus   train station which means you have to pass through the security checks with all non hotel guests coming off the train   buses from elsewhere.If you walk, you will come to the Disney Village entrance which is blocked by security checks. You just put any rucksacks on the conveyer belt through the x ray. Hardly any delay. But if you go via the train   bus station there is a larger security check area which every day had masses of queues. We made the mistake the first day of going through the hotel   Disney village check then exiting the other side of the village through to the train   bus area instead of going round to the left of the village and straight to the parks.So go left as you exit the village via the World of Disney store to avoid going through another security check.If you decide to venture into the train station for the cheaper shops then be aware that you will have to go through another security check to get back in.Extra Magic Hours. This basically allows hotel guests to get in the park 2 hours early. 8   10am. Note that only Disneyland Park does this not the studios. Only certain rides are open early (small world, carousel, teacups, Dumbo, buzz lightyear and space mountain).We tried getting to some of these rides early and found the queues to be just as bad as they were during the day. If you want to get on Dumbo quick then be there for 8am!If you do take advantage of the extra magic hours you will need to bear right as you approach the Disney hotel   park entrance. Staff will check your hotel pass and park tickets before allowing you in.The parks opened at 10am and closed 11pm for Disneyland and 7pm for studios. I would advise you get there as early as possible to run to your favourite ride!Meals:Well burgers, pizzas and other fast(ish) food are the order of the day. Some places have extra bowls of salad. The Earl of Sandwich (Disney Village) is probably the most reasonable food place (it   s a sort of cross between Subway   Starbucks   Mc Donalds).We and many others got the feeling that Disneyland Paris were on a tight budget this year. There seemed to be many things cut back (inc parades, maintenance, character roaming). Characters:Cut backs? There were less around saying it was peak season. People were queuing near the princess pavilion to meet a princess (1 hour wait). You got the occasional character appear and get mobbed by pushy parents.We took a character breakfast at Cafe Mickey and at first I was a bit skeptical due to the cost. But the self service hot food was excellent and the character one on one interaction was brilliant for the children.Tip:Studios have characters appear 1pm   3pm for 10   15 minutes a time right outside the areas near Cinemagique   Stitch Live. If you sit on the studio stage area you can see the characters come down the side of Cinemagique area and try and get to them before the mob sees them.Pram Strollers:Take a cheap buggy (even if your child   s 4 or 5   there   s a lot of walking).Attractions:Queues, queues, queues. I couldn't believe how busy the parks were every day. Even the fast loading rides had queue lengths of 40 minutes minimum. Oh and if a cast member suddenly says the ride is broken down or temporary closed, hang around. On many occasions, Big Thunder Mountain, Studio Tram Ride, Disney railroad (frontierland station) we were told its temporary shut. Only to find once the crowd had dispersed they opened it again.Oh and Crush's Coaster in the studios frequently had the worse queue management ever. Waiting times of nearly 2 hours. Get there for 9am (even though the studio only officially opens at 10am). People queue at the ride ready for 10am open.Fastpass:Fastpass is supposed to get you a time slot on the popular rides. You put your park ticket in a fastpass machine next to the ride and above you the clock will show a particular time slot when the ticket will be allowed. So you might get 10:30am   11:00am. You get a printed ticket with the time on and the idea is you return back within that time slot and get to enter the fastpass queue bypassing the long wait for the ride. Only so many tickets are allocated per time slot so the clock increments by 5 minutes when enough have been printed for a time slot. The biggest problem encountered here is that as soon as the park opens a huge throng of people hog the fastpass machines, thus creating a queue as long as the ride itself! And then what you find is people will start queuing in the fastpass ride entrance hours before their ticket is due. On many occasions we found that we had to queue behind time wasters only to eventually see the cast member start to look at everyone   s tickets (after about 10 minutes). Those not yet due their slot would just stand to the side but still hog the entrance. Annoying. Why CM's couldn't actually manage this better escapes me.Parades:To us it seemed that the studios parade was a cut down version of one a few years back. The difference is that this parade lasted about 10 minutes with about 5 cars of  stars . No dancing, stopping or interaction required!The Disneyland Park parade was better but still not as good as a few years back. Lasted about 20 minutes.Fireworks:We made the mistake of getting to the end of Main Street USA ready to grab a spot around an hour before the show. Not a chance. Even if you get a reasonable view of the castle you immediately get blocked by a swarm of iPads, mobiles and cameras lifted into the air whilst folks try and record the whole show.The next day we grabbed a spot right in front of the castle (to the left near the iron fencing). We got there 2 1 2 hours early for the 11pm show! Not the best for small children to hang around for so long but if you keep them entertained they will be fine. The Disney Dreams show is really worth watching. You need to get a good spot to see the cartoon images projected onto the water sprays as some of them are quiet low on the castle.Tip: Many people were sat with iPads, consoles and books whilst they waited to pass the time. Go to the toilet before you get your spot, stock up on food and DON'T move!You will find a lot of ignorant people will slowly try and push their way into the smallest places if you leave any gap. Sounds ruthless but if you have been waiting for 2 hours only to find someone trying to shove in the last minute it will wind you up.One thing I learned on this particular trip is to leave your manners at home, as most of the crowd we encountered couldn't care less.Smoking:Each to their own but when as a family we enter a park which is supposed to be a no smoking (except in designated areas) we don't expect cigs lighting up outside the shops, sat waiting for parades, waiting for the fireworks and worse of all waiting in the queues.To see adults lighting up in front of small children stuck in ride queues is disgusting. I lost count of the amount of times our children nearly turned round into someone   s cig ends. There are areas in the park for smokers. Children   s ride queues are certainly not one of them. The whole park was littered with cig ends. Not one cast member asked anyone to put out their cig. If you have children who have chest problems then seriously think twice about losing your temper with the free for all smoking attitude. I don't recall this ever being so bad in the past nor do I remember anyone allowed to smoke in Walt Disney World in Florida.Staff (Cast Members):To be honest we didn't have many issues with cast members. Most were pleasant and as long as you give a little courtesy and try and speak a little French you should be OK. Just a  bonjour  and  merci  at a minimum. Most staff will recognise you as being English and speak in English. Ordering set meals from menus has been made easy with a simple  menu 1  or  menu 2  choice. The fun is when you try and customise them.You will encounter the occasional grumpy one though so be prepared to just point at things.Summary:In summary the park was over crowded every day, fastpasses had run out by 12pm, Disneyland Paris seemed to be recreating scenes from Mary Poppins London smog filled streets with the amount of smokers puffing away, queues were horrendous and rides constantly broke down. The weather was brilliant though :)Disneyland Paris used to appeal to all ages but now seems to have lost its appeal to families with children.I would seriously consider saving the extra cash for next time and doing the Florida version.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We did come over three years ago in February and we had a nice time this week was a completely different story...We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch which was actually nice, very dark but clean and local to the park. I guess it went downhill from there.We have a disabled son so knew that we could get a pass in 'City Hall' which would enable us to access the rides easier. After a 35 minute queue a lady took our details and before handing over the pass decided to ask and tick off a range of boxes that applied to our sons needs; 'is he mentally deficient?' She asked. I'm sure there are more sensitive and more appropriate ways to address this. You would think the pass would make our life easier... We were wrong. After fighting the crowds to get to The pirate ride we were told that we needed to book a time slot   we did this for four hours later (the earliest slot they had) and fought our way back through the crowds to Thunder mountain for my eldest daughter   that wasn't working so then to Space Mountain   we collected the fast pass and went to the buzz lightyear ride   we waited 40 minutes at the disabled gate, a Disney Customer Service Rep walked by and asked us if she could help   I explained what we were waiting for and she replied with ' I'm not on this section so I can't help you!' I could go on about the fact that Space Mountain then broke down, the fact that a Disney Rep pushed our wheelchair out the way to make space for another family so we couldn't see the parade, the disgusting toilets, the rude staff and the fact that even when you ask people not to blow spoke in your sons face they then do it again on purpose, the way we were told to make our way to the disabled seats through a crowd of people sitting on the floor in Playhouse Disney without any help, the way we were told to hurry up off the slinky dog ride as we were holding up the queue (not easy with a 7 years old who can't walk), I could go on, but you get the picture.Having been to both Florida and California I find it hard to believe that they are in the same company as euro disney   it needs a whole new fresh management system and someone who is customer service orientated driving it forward.We won't be going back ever again.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We tried to get our refund no joy. They told us we should have told them his age when we bought the ticket, but there is NO WHERE around the ticket area that announces the discount.Second the prices. A 2 park one day pass is 79 euros (about 90 U.S) which is more than a park hopper at WDW with 4 parks included and a lot more attractions in the U.S., Paris is missing some of the best rides. We knew that going in and decided to go anyway. We made the mistake of not bringing water an lunch to the park. The prices at any theme park are outrageous, but Disney Paris is looking to break records! A 2 ounce bag of chips was 4 euros! A bottle of water was 8. Absolutely horrible. We cancelled our dinner reservations in the park because of the prices and went back to Paris to eat, missing the nighttime show simply because inner was more ridiculously price than any 5 star restaurant in Paris!The crowds were awful. Disney in the states will shut the gates if it gets that full. No less than a 90 minute line anywhere. No crowd control at all! Pickpockets were in force as well, there is no security and we saw several people upset because they had been victimized.Anyone who is used to Disney in the U.S., needs to eware rides are NOT the same! Indiana Jones and Space Mountain have loops that go upside down. I am not a person who can handle upside down, and I expected the same rides.

The trip was for our 4 year old grand daughter and although she enjoyed herself we didn't really find anything had changed from when we took our own kids soon after the Parc opened. Discoveryland was pretty much as it had been but 20 years older and looking it!Very few of the Parc staff are customer focused, in fact I told one to smile while serving us as she looked as miserable as sin, definitely a case for 'Undercover Boss'   I don't think Disney Execs would be very impressed!A warning   beware the buggy stroller 'thieves'! Buggies can be hired for 15 euros a day and very useful they are too but the only way to identify them is a name card placed in a see through holder on the handle. When leaving them outside rides there is no way of securing them and they have a habit of not being there when you come out! We had ours 'stolen' twice which meant a trip back almost to the entrance to pick up another one   no charge but still very annoying, meanwhile somebody is swanning around the Parc in a buggy they haven't paid for.Ranch Davy Crockett came in for some criticism and I must admit I was a bit worried but apart from the 'cabin' being very dark (and looking it's 20 years) accommodation was OK. You must try and get a package deal though and would certainly recommend half board as the fairly mediocre food throughout the Parc is very expensive. Best couple of meals we had were in the Disney Village   how anyone finishes the portions in Annette's Diner is beyond me!Can't say I wouldn't recommend Disneyland Paris but they do need to remind the staff that they are only there because of the paying guests and a refurbishment programme and some updated rides etc wouldn't go amiss.Would I go again   probably not.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The queues were typically well over one hour for (mainly mediocre) rides lasting little more than a minute. The staff who were in evidence were often incompetent, meaning that changeovers for rides were far longer than they would have been in a competently run bank holiday funfair in England. There were so few Disney characters that the few who did appear were mobbed, prompting their minders to threaten to 'take them away'. It seems to be part of the business plan that with so little to do other than queue, visitors are forced to enter one of the shops which dominate the entire park. If you or your family love theme parks, there are many which are vastly better and cheaper in the UK. if you or your family love Disney characters, they will experience disappointingly few of them here: there were barely any walking around in the long hours that we were there.

Well you've come to the right place!First of all, I am not going to make comparisons with the excellent Disneyland in California or Disneyworld resort in Florida   but it is clear that DLP would benefit from some Disney Corporation intervention.1. The main entrance. Accepting that August is the busiest time to go, there can be no excuse for the lack of control in place at the entry point where bags are checked. Even with the presence of horseback police, this was chaotic and highly dangerous   even at 11am on a weekday. We were nearly crushed and suffocated for over 30 minutes as people pushed from all sides, as staff screamed loudly in an effort to gain some control. Truly appalling to be herded in this way and an area for immediate attention before someone is seriously injured.2. The attractions. Where is the investment? Nothing has changed here in years. The park is screaming out for a new attraction or 3, and is yet to receive updates to existing attractions which have been applied at all other parks globally, e.g. Star Tours.3. The queues. Again accepting that we chose to go at the busiest time, the manner of the queues, not just the length was hard to tolerate at times. Pushing in, jumping over barriers, pretending to know someone near the front of the line   all the tactics were deployed to great annoyance of decent and patient guests. 4. Ride reliability. On a single day we witnessed Big Thunder Mountain break down, Pinocchio (twice) and Peter Pan   all after extensive queueing. Additionally the Rock and Rollercoaster Avec Aerosmith, stopped for 5 minutes in the dark, in the final tunnel before we could get off. When you are clamped in tight, this can be quite scary when there is no explanation or reassurances offered.5. Staffing. The place seemed genuinely understaffed with many cast members looking inexperienced (especially when rides broke down). Furthermore, we did not spot a single Disney character during the 4 days in the parks, except during parade time. Was this Disneyland?6. The clientele. Whilst smoking is on the decrease in other civilised parts of the world, you cannot escape it throughout DLP. If anything it has got worse. Sure, the Fume Interdiction signs are now displayed   but what's the point when they are not enforced. There is also a noticeable change   shift in the clientele (behaviourally and visually) which could be a contributory factor to the park's decline.My advice to the park   sit up and take notice before it is too late.Would we return?

When we planned our trip to Disneyland Paris we expected the high standards and quality of service and experience that we have had at the other parks. We were VERY disappointed with Disneyland Paris and it makes me very sad that for many people, especially Europeans, this is their first exposure to Disney and after it, they will likely be completely turned off all things Disney for life and unwilling to give it another chance. The park was worn down and dirty. I know it's the culture, but people were smoking and littering everywhere despite the posted signs. But the worst was the surly and unhelpful staff. Also, the process for seeing the Princesses was preposterous. You line up for a  reservation  time. You come back later and still wait almost an hour, THEN you get to visit with just one princess, and you don't even get to pick which one. What 7 year old Princess worshipper would be happy with that? The rides were fine, same as elsewhere, but the crowds were ridiculous. I think that in the US, they would have stopped admitting people before it got that crazy crowded. We paid a ridiculous amount of money to stay at the (terrible) Hotel Cheyenne and take advantage of the Extra Magic Hours, but during those hours, only a small part of the park was actually open and most of the rides we wanted to do weren't running yet. It was just a big let down and I know that has to do with expectations, but isn't that what the Disney brand is supposed to represent? I want to blast it all over the internet that people need to stop going there so they will have to make changes, because it was so packed they probably don't even care how terrible it is and they won't as long as they are still making money.

Took the train from Paris to Disneyland, approximately 40 mins, 2 metro tickets cost 14.90 EUR (oneway). Children under 4 travel free.We arrived there around 10.30. I had booked the tickets online (59 EUR each, children under 3 free entrance).Just before entering the park, there is a huge security checkpoint, they check all of the bags. There were only 4 queues lines for the security check so they were quite long. Anyway, after about 10 mins went through to the turnstiles to enter the park. Out of about 15 turnstiles only about 6 was open but it was not a huge line to enter the park. Once inside we rented a stroller, 15 EUR. If you take the rented stroller between the parks, you need to leave a 70 EUR deposit ( credit card or cash) and show the form to the turnstiles when exiting one park.The park had more adults than children. The queues for the attractions and rides was full of adults, not kids. Which made the lines longer and at the expense of families with kids. Although on the website it indicated designated smoking areas, there were adults smoking all over the place. It was disgusting. Not even in Paris did i experience so many smokers in one place. And not a single Disney personel to tell them they cannot smoke in un designated areas. I understand even an adult would want to experience Disneyland, but then get them to pay for it rather than just going to every ride at the expense of children.The Disney Park is mostly just shops, with Disney merchandise. Once you enter these you have to buy something, cause it is rather tempting the way they display them. The attractions are not at all what i imagined they would be. Very poorly maintained. Went through the Wild West area, it was just some empty deserted buildings, with nothing interesting to see. I saw 3 disney people wearing cowboy jackets and a toy pistol sidearm. And they were just walking not doing any sort of act. Boring.The Disney castle is tiny, I always imagined it to be much bigger, the way they advertise it.Not a single parade.

Didn't wait as it was too long. Not one single other disney character was seen for the almost 3 4 hours we walked about and spent in queues. The queue time for the other attractions was a minimum of 30 mins, going upto at least 1 hour for the train rides. The smallest wait time was for the boat ride which was about 10 mins.Ate 3 hotdogs, just a plain bun with an undercooked sausage, 6.80 EUR each. No mustard sauce, just some ketchup.The walt disney studios is the same. Nothing to see, not at all interesting.

1334,172275637,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Please read all of this review, it   s written as a parent who went to DLRP with open eyes, not a grown adult with the mentality of a six year old. We paid a lot of money for our stay there (my wife, I and our 6 year old daughter) and there are many things wrong with the resort than are right. I don   t know where to start, so I   ll get the obvious out of the way first, but I   ll come back to one point. Firstly, queues are going to be a given and they are going to be long, end of. Secondly, prices, anybody who goes to DLRP and doesn   t (or even does) expect it to be expensive is deluding themselves and there   s no point in complaining about it, that   s the way it is, end of, get used to it, they want your money, and you   ll give it to them (you already have).OK, the gripes. Firstly, 99.9% of the staff look miserable, bored, and sullen and can be rude. They really haven   t taken on the Disney customer service ethos. It   s difficult to find one who smiles (I saw two or three), they don   t try to make eye contact or speak English, which reminds me of another point thank you. They are there doing their job, they get paid minimum wage and generally give minimum service. The two we had good experiences of went out of their way to help us, and we were very grateful for their help, but they were the exceptions rather than the norm. Secondly, the park looks old, dated, tatty, and a bit worn out. OK, it   s been open 21 years, but it doesn   t look like some of the park hasn   t had a lick of paint since it was opened. The toilets show the signs of well used toilets, often smelly and wet underfoot (I can   t speak for the ladies obviously), but regular checks seem to be lacking.Thirdly, DLRP apparently has a    No smoking    rule in the park, this is woefully disregarded and completely unenforced. Why grown people want to walk around a theme park designed for the enjoyment of children either holding a burning cigarette at child head height or waving it about, or even whilst waiting in the queues, is really beyond me, if you NEED to smoke, go out of the park and do it there for Gods sake, we observed cigarette ends everywhere, and I mean everywhere, it looks disgusting, we even saw children playing with them, which ok, is the parents fault for not stopping them, but if they weren   t there in the first place, problem solved. The smoking issue also cast a dark shadow on our holiday when one of our neighbours across the channel waved his cigarette around, burning our daughters brand new Disney toy, this might seem trivial, but for one thing it cost 26euros and was ruined, and secondly, if she hadn   t been holding the toy the way she was, his cigarette would have burned its way into her eye. Smoking in such a crowded park is an issue DLRP needs to address. Fourthly, queues (again) and rides, DLRP seems to have taken    how to make things not be seen    lessons from the SAS, short queues are deceiving, the real queue is generally hidden from view round a corner until you are actually committed to be in it. The times shown are completely inaccurate, for example, the waiting time for the    Tower of terror    was shown to be 35mins, when in fact it was probably twice that long, the    fast pass    system for that ride had been closed, so it was decided that there was no time for it. The queue for    Crush   s Coaster    ride was 80mins long, again too long for a six year old to stand in. DLRP needs to put some sort of entertainment in place for the long queues, it was suggested in another review that some video screens showing cartoons in the longer queues might be the way forward and I agree. The rides seemed to be poorly maintained, (   Thunder mountain    broke down while we were there and this is apparently a regular thing), and often a waste of time, we queued for near on an hour to go on the    Cars rally    ride, half of the ride   s cars were out of operation, and the safety checks for the ride actually lasted longer than the ride itself. The Carousel de Lancelot, although there was no queue, only lasted a turn and a half, again nowhere near as long as the safety checks. You need to be paying attention if there are any announcements, they will always be in French first and rushed English second (if at all), the first attraction we went through, the spoken parts were completely in French, luckily the queen of hearts really only said one thing, so we could guess, but our six year old daughter? We also took in the stunt show in the studio, the cast members seemed to sometimes forget that they weren   t catering to a completely French audience, forgetting at times to translate, and blabbering away in French while the English were left to guess what they were saying. There was also one point when Lightning McQueen turned up, Mater was on the big screen talking in French while Lightning spoke English, what was the point of that? When we went to the    Armageddon    attraction, the cast member decided that because there were more French people than any other race in our group she would talk solely French and we were left to read the screens to find out what was going on, the attraction turned out to be THE biggest waste of time, avoid it at all costs, it really is time best spent elsewhere, probably the queue for another ride. DLRP needs to decided which language it wants to use and stick to it.The good points were the parades which our daughter really enjoyed and the    Disney dreams    show at park closing time which was utterly magical, but you need to get there well on time to appreciate, again however, it was a mix of French and English talking which seemed a bit pointless. The people who say this resort is a magical, wonderful place are either obviously really easily pleased and as I have said, have the mentality of a six year old, or have too much bloody money and don   t care about its failings. Disney should have walked away from this place when it had the chance. This review will be followed up by an email to DLRP, which if their cast member   s attitudes are anything to go by, will be promptly deleted.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

They should have a limit on daily visitors because queues were ridiculous and wait times were but a lie. Rides saying 20 min wait were really a 40 min wait. My 2 little girls couldnt even visit the princess pavilion because there were 3 separate queues to get tickets   what???? 1) You shouldn't have to spend on tickets to meet disney characters after paying hefty sums at the entrance and 2) everyone should have access to them abd not have to queue for 3 4 hours to get 'tickets' to see them. I even overheard people with tickets being told they had to further wait and to come back after 30 40 mins, by rude obnoxious staff! Everything was overpriced   kids toys, costumes and even the food   and they all were of the worst quality.

The park is dirty, the toilets are dirty, there is smoking everywhere   the non smoking policy isn't enforced, there is queue jumping, weeds growing on the rides, the food is poor quality and the cost is excessive. My advice would be save your money and go to Florida, at least they know how to run a park and make it an unforgettable experience.Ok, so we decided rather last minute to pop in here as part of our holiday, we bought a 2 day 2 park ticke for 2 adults and 2 children on the door at just over Euro 500. Plus we paid Euro 15 per day for parking. Fine, we've been to disney in Florida and we don't mind paying for something good. Judging by the car park the park was only half full, but it seemed rammed, went on a ride with a 35 minute queue time and queued for an hour, it then became aparent that the queue times at the front of the rides are a load of rubbish. Plus you have to have your wits about you in the queue as the families behind constantly try to slink past you, probably because you are having a caughing fit because the people in front are smoking, even though it's not allowed. We dreaded having to use the toilets, didn't see a cleaner once and at least 50% were unusable due to being flooded or just filthy. Graffiti all over them and dirty toilet paper on the floor. Disgusting. The cost for coffee and sort drinks was between 3 and 4 euros. I know these parks have to make some money, but really, the cost v the quality was a rip off. Went into Planet Hollywood to eat, it cost us over   100 for 2 children and 2 adults and we didn't bother to stay for dessert as the service was so slow.

To stand in queue for over an hour, then to get into one of the rides for just over a minute is not right. They MUST find a solution as I had a couple of very disappointed kids.To hardly have any signage in the park is not right, to have a website and an app designed by immatures is a crime. To go to a restaurant at 4.55 pm and to be told cant serve you as we close at five is strange. To go to another restaurant and stand in a queue for 30 minutes to place an order and pay is stupid, especially when there are many staff there doing nothing and when asked to have another cashier, I was given the shrugged shoulder.This place needs major overhaul and re organization, to make me stand in three queues just to get access to the princess pavilion irritated me and made me promise myself that I would be Disneylands Europe worst ambassador and make sure I tell everyone I know (and those I don't ) that the place does not deserve to have the Disney name associated with it.

On one of our days, we only managed to do four rides (and that was with the fast pass!) On the first day, four of the major rides were out of commission. On the next three days two of the major rids were out of commission. The fast pass was of little use as this could only be issued for two hours form the time you requested it, and you could only have one at a time. All fast passes had run out by two o'clock. The park was actually looking in bad repair all round and quite a few of the features were not functioning. The ghost images in the mirrors of the haunted house were not working (perhaps these have still not been repaired). The geyser water feature in the Wild West was not working (I am sure this has not been repaired). The show in the saloon of the Wild West was not on. Is this how Euro Disney always functions? It was impossible to get an invitation to meet and greet the princesses, as the queue was an hour long, and they only gave out a limited amount of tickets per day. The queues to meet the other Disney characters were at least half an hour long. The merchandise was overpriced (70 Euros for a princess dress!) The rides are dated and cheesy. I really was expecting a lot more. The fireworks display was wonderful and the Princess lunch was awesome, but expensive, and Mickey Cafe was also great, but expensive.

This summer, we got to add Disney Paris to the list. We had high expectations based on our other experiences. Ultimately, we had a lovely day, so I can't be too hard on Disney Paris. We loved the castle!! BUT, there were two main problems that we had that really could be fixed. First, the majority of rides were either down all day or not functioning for large parts of the day. Fast pass was useless. We spent a lot of time walking from ride to ride only to find they were closed. Or, worse yet, we'd be standing in long queues for a ride and it would shut down. Second, the staff need to smile, make eye contact, and otherwise appear to like their job. I mean, really, it's Disney!! Many of the ride food staff just looked irritated and distracted. For this reason, I am glad Disney Paris was not our first Disney experience, or we'd be totally turned off. The one exception, was a most enjoyable young man working at the Tower of Terror. The ride had technical difficulty (see above problem) while we were in line and he made an effort to make it fun for everyone. At the end of the day, we approached customer service and reported our experience to them. To their credit, they offered us free tickets to return on another day. The tickets, however, could only be used at Disney Paris which was not an option for us. So, they gave my daughter a small stuffed animal instead.

After hearing our issues she gratfully gave us some Fast track tickets to both Buzz Light Year, and Space Mountain (these were the rides that we had mostwanted to go on), we left her to tackle a very p'd lady and off to grab our last rides for the day.Well that was our plan, to everyones pure delight (NOT) both of the rides were out of service.This is the point were we all gave up and decided that the hotel was a better option.For our next attempt at such outings, we're thinking of trying one of the Universal or Six Flag attractions, for if this is how Disney runs a park, then we'll be giving them all a massive berth.Gary",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Took our 7 year old Granddaughter to have her be upset on several occasions as the Character Guides had the well known Gallic attitude of just standing around as pushy parents blatantly pushed their Child to the front of the queue for character autographs. Did not seem at all interest at the call of many parents to stop letting French children in first and just shrugged their Shoulders and in most cases just turned there backs towards you. Paid extra to stay at the Newport Hotel with the promise of early access to find on one of the days we went down to get in early to Magic Kingdom was told by the Gate Guide that they where not letting in people early that day without any other reason, asked to see a manager and just got the usual gallic Shoulder Shrug which also was the response to all the other annoyed early bird ticket holders. My advice is save up and get a real Disney Experience at Disney World Florida.. As for the food quality the best food on offer was off site at McDonalds if you didn't mind a very long queue which will show how poor the food quality was. On several occasions had to return stone cold food back to the provider where you noticed they just put the food back on the food tray to pass on to another customer who would not probably complain. The last point is I live in Yorkshire and the Weather is really poor in this area of France with a cold wind blowing in most areas of Disneyland Paris.

Only good part of the whole experience!!We booked 4 nights at Sequoia Lodge and came home after 3, we had had enough. The hotel itself was OK, a bit tired in need of refurbishment. Two double beds, unable to get a family room or a room with 1 double and 2 singles. Very basic, no coffee tea making facilities. Just two beds, TV, wardrobe and bathroom, very smelly hallways.We booked bed and breakfast, we arrived early for check in 11.45am on day 1, by which time all the breakfast passes for the hotel other than 7.15 had gone so we were forced to trek to Disneyland Park for breakfast at 9.15. First day was at Plaza Gardens, great no probs shown to a table, continental brekky, no long queues, day 2 at Au Chalet de la Marionette, not seated, queue for brekky, then queued for 25 mins for a table then 20 mins for a coffee absolute nightmare. Not ideal that you can't get breakfast in the hotel that you have paid for!The fast pass in DP Parks works on a one at a time basis, e.g. if you get a fast pass for Peter Pans flight with a time of 16.30 and it's only 10.00am you cannot get another fast pass until that one has been used so choose carefully. The queues were on average about 45 minutes for most rides.The Characters are a complete let down, they were down right rude! We had 2 children both with an autograph book both desperate for autographs and photos, they got 1 autograph between them and not a single photo. The character Suzy pushed them out of the way and Wendy from Peter Pan was asked by another parent where the queue started as she was having the same problems with trying to get photos and autographs and was told 'there is no queue, we choose who we want to be photographed with and who's book we want to sign'. Complete and utter waste of time even trying to get an autograph.Food and drinks in the park mega expensive, toffee apple 3.50, candyfloss 4.00, coffee 4.00, burger   hot dog, fries and drink 14.00. Eat at the Disney Village, their is a McDonalds offering the same but go large for 6.90. Also Ludwigs Castle is a bar in the Village and they do a happy hour from 17.00 to 19.30 half price everything. Drinks in hotel Bar 7.00 for a beer, 4.00 for a coke.Overall they have managed to turn Disney magic into just a theme park in France.

Half the rides were closed and the prices had gone up so much since last year it wasn't even funny. It was roughly   16 for burger and chips a small bottle of water was   4! If you are a family you spend an absolute fortune. We stayed in the Hotel Cheyenne and we had to move rooms 3 times! Firstly the first room they gave us was the wrong one and we couldn't gain entry with the key card and we had unpacked the car and had all the luggage with us. They then moved us to a completely different block which took us ages with all the cases and bags and two children only to find that the second room they put us in already had people in it. We entered the room to find handbags passports and money on the bed it was most uncomfortable so yet again we had to go back to reception only to be moved back to the first block but a different room and they didn't even offer to help with the luggage   we were so annoyed. We were so stressed before we even got to the park with the children. Never again if you have children don't do it but if its a stag or hen weekend its ideal.

The parents were all puffing away on their cigarettes and blowing smoke into their kids' faces. Needless to say, we were not spared from all that secondary ciggie smoke.Unfortunately for us, the day turned out to be quite a cold one with rain the the forecast. Hence, many families sought shelter in covered areas close to the eating areas as well as near the toilets. When they started smoking there as well, those supposed rest areas became filled with cigarette smoke which meant that we could hardly a respite from the rain nor cigarette smoke!

What should have been the trip of a lifetime for her   turned out to be a 'nightmare'. ~Unfortunately, it seems if you are disabled at Disney then your options to ride become limited. They appear to have a rule that only 1 disabled person can ride at any one time!!!!!!! Therefore, all the able bodied pile on and the disabled have to sit and wait or in our case 'book an appointment'! (I thought you only did that at the hairdressers doctors etc.,) Unfortunately, my little granddaughter requires a wheelchair and does not understand the concept of having to wait and gets very distressed. On the first day we found a lovely ride (small world) it was perfect because they had an adapted boat and we could wheel her right on   she loved it and we went round twice! There were only three rides in the park that she could tolerate, but small world was her favourite. We went back the following two days and had a great experience until FRIDAY! We arrived at the ride and there was a small group of 3 waiting in the disabled queue. We were met by one of the attendants to be told  you will have to make an appointment . My daughter and I looked flabbergasted and asked why because we hadn't done this on the previous three days   so what had changed. She told us we could come back in approx. 1 hour 20 min and waived papers in front of us of what appeared to be bookings. By this time the people who had been sat in the disabled queue had boarded and set off. My granddaughter was getting really distressed and we were trying to calm and reassure her. Then the boat which is designed to carry the wheelchair arrived and we pointed out that this was free and not being used   so why could she not have a ride. Again the attendant waived papers at us and stipulated we needed an appointment!! The three of us left small world in tears! They could not see or acknowledge that this little girl had been left frustrated, distressed and very confused!! The staff do not appear to use what we call 'COMMON SENSE'!!!!!!!!!! Because that's all that was required and a little girls day would have been made and not ruined. Disney overall for the disabled (depending on level of disability) easy to push round, grounds very nice but if wheelchair bound only a few rides available. They all indicate person must be able to transfer themselves!

The rides were fun, of course, if you could cope with a long wait for each   in the US these queues were entertained by Disney characters, magicians, conjurors, singers, but not Paris where there was absolutely nothing. Indeed most of the staff were grumpy and bored, a total contrast to the buzz and fun generated at the original Park. Many of the rides closed early, so our children were denied to chance to ride the steamboat or take the train which had packed up by early evening (even though the Park was advertised as being open until 11pm.) As for the food   what a joke. Most of the outlets were shut. Those that were open offered long queues for the privilege of enduring very average junk food at fancy prices. Finally, out of desperation, we booked into the Silver Spur steakhouse, where I had a barely adequate steak, my wife's salmon had to go back as it was scarcely warm, the children's skewer meals were just about OK   and the bill was well over   100. Casting round for some upside   we really enjoyed the motor stunt show in the Studios section. This went some way to offset the 30 minutes wait at the ticket booth while sullen and semi competent staff messed about trying to decide whether to accept our fully paid Brittany Ferries Disneyland tickets   they did so in the end.

The park had our expectations high yet we have had much better experiences at theme parks that cost 1 6th as much as this did, literally. The entrance alone was 400 Euros. The food is overpriced so much that it is outrageous.The park is outdated, dirty, and old. As one other post wrote, it is past its use by date. The motor car ride had mechanics on duty repairing card constantly, on the fly, and there were traffic jams caused by several broken down cars. For goodness sakes buy new motors after 20 years and fix it. The Buzz Lightyear ride broke down 4 times while we were on it! 4 times, I kid you not! The only new stands are the 4001 souvenir shops that are everywhere. The rides are few and far between. None of them are of the quality we expect after visiting parks such as Legoland (Germany), Warner Bros World (Aust), Wet   N   Wild, Seaworld or even Luna Park in Sydney which must be older than Disneyland. The wait is intolerable, not just for rides but also food and tickets. The staff are on the whole where rude and only there for their own social life with other staff. The exception were the grounds staff who diligently picked up the litter dropped by thoughtless people. Many of the rides were broken. We were there for a full day. We rode for about 10 minutes. We queued for about 6 hours. The toilets were disgusting; old and dirty.Although there is a policy in small writing not to smoke in the main areas this is not followed through and the cigarette smoke is outrageous, especially that the main customers there are very young children.This park should be boycotted by the general public.

1401,161592197,2,2013-2,United States,"I grew up going pretty regularly to Disneyland in Anaheim, California (my family lived about 40 minutes from there). I now am pretty ambivalent about Disney and Disneyland in general. As a child, I loved Disneyland and Disney movies and characters, but in adolescence the  fakeness  of Disneyland started bothering me, and now as an adult I realize how important it is to find a variety of options to entertain children (and for them to entertain themselves), and am much more aware that spending a lot of money isn't necessary for children to have fun. The  Disney experience  is so expensive, and many people cannot afford it. We bought a three day pass for the Disneyland outside of Paris and were there in late February 2013. We stayed at a very nice but inexpensive hotel one metro stop away from the parks. It had a kitchenette (including small refrigerator, stove, microwave, tableware, and a mini dishwasher) so we purchased groceries at the nearby E. Leclerc in the mall. Preparing simple meals in our room helped us to keep expenses down. Disneyland was a big disappointment. It was unusually cold and it even snowed; we are from a very cold area in the US and so have plenty of experience dealing with inclement weather, but Disney doesn't. Many rides closed. Lines were long (waits ranged from 45 to 90 minutes); Fast Passes ran out early; adults smoked cigarettes in lines but weren't asked to stop by employees; bathrooms weren't well attended to; and overall for us adults, it wasn't much fun. I don't think that the weather was only the cause of all this. Our daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself  this was her first trip to a Disneyland and she was happy to go on the rides for younger children. She also loved meeting Mickey, and we appreciated the one on one time in the room with  him,  and the photo opportunities. So all that said: If going to Disneyland is your and or your child's dream, go for it. Be prepared for the expense. If you are on the fence about going, or are considering other options, I'd say spend the money and the time on a different excursion.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Most of our time was spent exploring nooks and crannies of the city or visiting the big sites like the Orsay, Sacre Coeur, and others. But on a lark we decided to try out the Paris Disneyland. Our family is from Southern California, and we've enjoyed numerous trips to Disneyland in Anaheim. We thought it would be a fun addition to an already spectacular stay. We did find ways to enjoy ourselves at the park, but it really took a lot of work. The place simply isn't up to the standard of the US parks, and our time and money would have been much better spent enjoying even more of Paris or the French countryside. I will concede that there are a few bright spots in this park: The design is a nice European update to the standard look of the US parks. The layout is very similar to the US parks, which makes navigation easy. The Space Mountain in Paris is a much better roller coaster than either of the US versions, too. My kids wanted to ride that one all day. But there were several things that just didn't sit well with us:1) Disney parks in the US are obsessive about cleanliness, order, and friendliness to families. Not so in the Paris park. First, there was cigarette smoke everywhere. I get it. We're in Europe. People still smoke a lot. But in a Disney park? Second, there was graffiti everywhere. Third, just like in the old, broken down amusement parks I used to sneak into as a kid, stairways and hallways smelled of urine. Needless to say, the smoke graffiti urine combo made waiting in lines less than pleasant.2) There simply aren't as many rides as in the US parks. The usual suspects are there  Pirates, Space Mountain, Autopia, Peter Pan. But after exhausting those, we went looking for other rides to enjoy, and there just weren't many options. The slim pickings also meant longer queues, with more folks waiting for fewer rides.3) It's suprising to say this about any establishment in France, but the food in the park just wasn't good. The candy apples and other foodstand options were mediocre, and the sit down meals were not much better. The one exception was the cotton candy stand right around the backside of the castle. It was the best cotton candy we have ever eaten anywhere. It's as if they took all the Disney magic out of the rest of the park and poured it into that cotton candy machine. Since our trip, I've spoken to a few friends who have visited the Paris Disneyland, and they all reached the same verdict: A few fun Disney bits, but a pale imitation of the real Disneyland.

1420,158208583,2,2013-4,Switzerland,"I worked in Eurodisney 20 years ago when I was a Student. I decided to come back this year with was my children aged 6 and 8. What a disappointment!!!!! We arrived on a very warm and sunny Sunday, probably the first one of the year. We stayed in the hotel NewYork where the check in, despite being very busy, was done in an efficient manner. All was well until we entered the park which was crowded (beyond capacity in my view). Every attraction showed between 50 and 60 minutes wait. A  fast pass  system was on offer which consisted in reserving a time slot and booking a ticket for the attraction in advance. when I went to book the tickets for the attractions, I soon found out that the earlier slot available was 2 hours later. This meant that we were not able to go on any attraction for the first 2 hours, so we decided to have a bite to eat instead but we soon found out that every restaurant (mostly fastfood that we don't particularly like) were totally packed and required a good 30 mns of queueing) we gave up that as well and looked around for somethingelse to do which did not require more than 10  15 minutes of queueing. We found a few things here and there without much interest, such as the visit of a crowded pirate ship and a dusty treehouse. It was finally time to go to to Star tour attraction. I was totally amazed to see that the film showed ( with a few effects) was exactly the same as 20 years ago. Same for the pirateship. It soon became apparent that most attractions were exactly as they were 20 years ago, nothing has been modernized and as a result the overall impression is of a dusty dated place with decors and automats that are outdated. The only available places to go without queueing are the Disney shops present all over the parc and village. I would have preferred to see more attractions and amenities and less shops. The Disney culture seems to be  milk people as much as possible with the least investment possible. ur concierge at the hotel recommended a restaurant for dinner called the Blue lagoon, apparently one of the most decorated one in the parc, it turned out to be one of those tacky places yet again totally outdated where one eat in the dark surrounded by fake coconuts and boats that are passing by and waving whilst we are eating. The food (mostly fish) was not fresh, and clearly reheated frozen food. terrible, except for the nice waiter who did make an effort and was lovely. i could go on and on with the bad experiences we had, such as queueing 20 minutes for an attraction and finally reaching the front of the line, to be told by microphone that  the attraction due to technical problems is now closed  ... There were a few good things worth mentioning though, the newest part of the parc called the Studios, were much less crowded and rather nice. the attraction in the hotel tower is absolutely great and so is the show at 11h30 which shows how to film an action movie with cars and motorbikes chases involving water fire and all sort of special effects. One last thing to mention which was also very difficult to swallow, is that despite charging 79 euro for an adult day ticket in the parc ( price for guests not staying in the hotels) There are still a lot of places where people have to pay extra, hot air balloons, giant balls on the ice ring etc...one thing is sure we will never come again, instead we will return time and again in Europa parc which in my view, despite being more expensive, offers a much much better value for money",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We have enjoyed each visit, would not hesitate to return and we were looking forward to our first visit with grandchildren.We were there for 4 nights from 10th 14th April and experienced same disappointments each day, rides continously breaking down, long queues for everything with people pushing in and not enough staff (especially weekends), many have no interest and bad attitude.The children loved the characters when you could find them but there was no organisation for photos and signatures with everyone pushing their children to get in first and then they would leave with no warning.If you plan to go with small children then 2 nights is enough and keep them to weekdays, keep patient and keep smiling although this will be a challenge at times. If you can spend some time beforehand to be familiar with the parks with what you would like to do then this will help save some time but unless you want to pay for all day fastpass then you can only have one fastpass at time and depending on demand the time between getting the pass and using it could be up to 3 to 4 hours.

paris with my disabled son and partner and i can tell you what a failure disneyland is to disabled people,on the first day we went to city hall to receive a disabled badge for easy access onto rides firstly the guy in city hall didnt understand us and gave us the wrong card which meant we couldnt get on many rides,i then went back the next day to get this card replaced to be told by another guy working in city hall that he couldnt give me another card as i already had one he was geting very nasty to me and actually said he didnt understand what i was saying which i found astonishing as he shouldnt be working there if he didnt understand,,,i come from belfast with a british accent not timbuktu..when i finally got this card replaced we set of to enjoy the rides but after showing this green card we where left standing whilst the ordinary queue was moving quicker than the disabled queue and this was when boats and rides passed with empty seats,also at the designated area for disabled people to watch the parade they had a rule that only one of the childs parent was allowed to enter this area with there disabled child which i found quite odd as his mum had to stand outside the disabled area which then made my son scared..also i had a argument with 3 of the staff at the train bus ride in disney village that takes you through the set of london and a mountain feature with a rush of water and fire,,,we entered the disabled area and showed are green badge for the ride and the girl at the disabled area said we would have to wait 30 mins to go on this ride and she marked us down in her folder which we didnt mind but she said we couldnt leave the area so we stood and waited then a crowd of people entered this area,this girl i was originallly talking to left and went on the tour and left somebody else in charge,we where told we where the next tour when it arrived but when it did arrive we never got on it and this was after waiting 45 mins already,i then called her and said we where meant to get on that tour and you let other people go in front of us and my child is starting to get distressed she then said sorry you are on the next one thats when i got angry and said are card number is in the folder that you have are you not reading it she then didnt no what to say and there was about 4 of them that huddled together and started talking french to each other as they obviously didnt no what they where doing which i then told them its a disgrace use dont no what is going on use need to start reading the folder and taking account for what use are doing,we then got on the ride after waiting 1 hour which was originally meant to be 30 mins as for the price of food in the park and hotels its a total disgrace mainly all burgers and chips and no decent food to be got anywhere,,for instance we got 3 burgers 3 chips and 3 cokes and it was 35 euro at todays going rate that is about 35 pounds sterling these are the prices all over disneyland and i dont think you would get any cheaper as some other areas are dearer and to be honest these are not great burgers and chips kfc is a lot better and thats honestly,,as for items for sale in the shops take your disneyshop in your high street in the uk and every item is double the price in the parks and hotels in disneyland.we also seen 2 rats in the park one was massive and the other was on its way there also..all in all french ignorant,expensive,wont be back,,staff training poor..rides breaking down whilst on them which was peter pan ride. french IGNORANT staff training is a must for disney staff...airport staff at charles de gaulle airport where also a total disgrace to my disabled son they didnt think he was disabled and he was in a wheelchair they made me lift him out for security and i already had details put on my holiday arrangements that he was which when i was explaining this at security and after showing them a disabled badge they didnt no what i meant,,passengers behind us at security actually came over to us at departure lounge and couldnt believe what happened and they even said that it was a disgrace at what they made us do,,,i believe that if you want to visit disneyland save your money for florida as eurodisney is not worth the money...ALSO keep your valuables with you at all times,we left my childs wheelchair pram outside the peter pan ride with my sons mickey mouse blanket draped over the back of the handles securely,when we got of the ride the blanket had been stolen which we couldnt believe what sick minded people are out there that they would steal a blanket of a disabled pram not to mention who would give there child another childs blanket is beyond belief,obviously who ever done this had watched us leaving the pram outside peter pan ride and entering the ride to then steal the blanket,to be honest we where glad as we could have easily left valuables attached to the pram,i asked the disney staff did they see anyone at the pram and yet again she didnt no what i was saying...TYPICAL..i hope this helps a lot of people make up there mind before they visit or think about visiting. thanks",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue

Well, among all of the Disney parks we've visited (Hong Kong, Los Angeles, and Tokyo), Paris Disneyland is, BY FAR, the absolute worst one.Firstly, staff training is poor. The staff are the ones who must be enabled to create the  magic . The service level is nowhere near that found at Tokyo Disneyland, where the crew members work so hard to ensure you have a great experience. The staff at PD were rude to us or others on several occasions. At the Haunted Mansion, some kids were talking and the attendant walked right up to them, put her face about 6 inches away from their faces and said,  It's RUDE to speak while I'm speaking.  What the hell? They're kids. Some rides are so understaffed that basic safety checks (like seat belt securely fastened, shoulder bar locked in place etc.) are not performed.Big Thunder Mountain broke down while we were there. Unbelievable and a sign that basic maintenance is poor.Secondly, there are designated smoking areas, but nobody enforces them. Adults (and some teenagers) were smoking throughout the park and extinguishing the butts anywhere they could. Even while waiting in line to buy tickets, or queue at entrances. What kind of family environment is that?The queues weren't all that bad the day we went, but the park standards are really poor.

As you can imagine we were both very excited to see the parks, its something i have wanted to experience my whole life (age 22), we entered the park and were very impressed by all the buildings and the castle, we got out our map and began to wonder round. we came across the first land 'discovery land' we went to the buzz lightyear lazer blast, went to queue and the guy tells us the ride is now closed due to techincal problems...ok, on to the next ride, space mountain, looks great, 80 minute queue, so we got a fast pass for over an hour later...when we came to use the pass we still waited for over 30 mins! hardly a 'fastpass'!! we then looked round and after realising there wasnt much else to look at in discovery land we went to get to the next land, followed what the map said and constantly lead us to dead ends, no sign posts as you can imagine this is highly frustrating when you dont know the place and want to explore!!

The service levels were poor and the queues for all of the attractions were massive. A photo with Mickey mouse entailed an 80 minutes queue which could not be avoided as my daughter was mad to meet the characters and this proved quite challenging. To get on even the small rides involved queueing for not less than 40 mins for 2 minute rides.I had promised that we would do lunch with the Disney Princess which we booked at the Auberge de Cendrillion. We had a half board package and were told that although the vouchers would not cover the whole cost we could pay the difference. However once seated we handed over our vouchers to be told that they were not usable in this restaurant although we had made the reservation at 'City Hall' by one of the Disney staff. This was our last day so we ended up having to pay 65 euros each for the adults and about 30 euros for my child and having an unusable voucher. The food was absolutely appalling I ordered venison and received pork fillet! I would say that the princesses were lovely and my little girl enjoyed it but to have to spend 150 euros as that was the only way for her to get to meet the princesses is absolutely disgusting! We spent 2 full days in the park and in that time the only character I saw walking around the park was The Mad Hatter in the far distance. For young children the magic is in seeing and meeting the characters and for there not to be any to be seen makes the advertising somewhat misleading! We went into several cafes and only on one occasion were we actually able to sit down in the cafe to consume what we had bought as there is insufficient seating for the volumes of people. On the first day we went to buy a hot dog and fries for my daughter from one of the cafes and had to queue for nearly 30 minutes in a queue with only 6 people in it and then she had to eat it in the street as there was nowhere to sit. It would seem that once they have got you into the park they do not feel it is necessary to offer any level of customer service at all.All in all I would say save your money and add a bit to it and go to Florida.

On top of this the ground wasn't gritted and in some places very dangerous, you would think with the silly profits they make they could grit the paths.My advise? If you must go to Disneyland Paris buy drinks and snacks at the train station, eat at Rainforest Cafe or Planet Hollywood, they're not cheap but the service is great. Head to Val du Europe 1 train stop away for gift buying as Disney expensive. Above all try and save up and go to America.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

There used to be shows and also actors playing out scenes in various locations around the park. Now there is nothing. We stayed 11 13th March when it snowed but no effort was made to clear paths or get rides ready. Lots of attractions were closed or opened late, even the indoor rides. People were walking around wondering what to do with their time. We saw many people slip on the snowy paths. There are an abundance of shops selling overpriced goods in which people were crowded trying to keep warm. The cost of food is ridiculous. We had purchased food vouchers in advance which saved us a little bit of money. I would suggest eating at a restaurant that serves buffet so you can eat as much as you want. The Plaza restaurant was good in the Magic Kingdom as it caters for vegetarians as well. You need to book a time. We stayed at the Newport Bay Club this time. Previously we stayed at the Santa Fe. Our room was nicely decorated but a double bed is a little small for us as neither my husband or myself sleep that well. Our granddaughter enjoyed having a bed all to herself though. The swimming pool was too cold to play around in. We ate breakfast at 7.30am. Any later than this and you would have to queue. It was good to be shown to a table and to keep going back to the buffet. At the Santa Fe we had to get all the food at one go and then find our own table. Drinks were really expensive in the bar.

Last time we visited was around 15 years ago when the park was quite new and we had memories of it being pretty magical. Since then we have gone to the California park many times and always enjoyed it, so it was with fairly high expectations that we headed off this weekend.The first thing we noticed was that the  clientele  was vastly different from before. Yes, there were many perfectly nice family groups from France, Germany, UK, Netherlands etc but it seems the park is now attracting a lot of low life types roaming the park , mostly Roma type men in their 30s from Eastern Europe. I would question their purpose in being there as they certainly weren't there for the rides. You'll spot them by their uniform of shiny puffa bomber jackets, jeans and trainers and strong cigarettes (in a non smoking park).We did the usual rides in Fantasyland, Small World was good and probably better than the USA one, Carousel was ok, Snow White, Pinocchio were fine, Peter Pan had a technical problem so we couldn't go on it. Heading off to Adventureland we were really disappointed to see that the Pirates of the Caribbean was closed as that was the main attraction we had wanted to see. No mention of this anywhere before going into the park. However the Haunted Mansion was excellent with great detail.We had Hot Chocolate and Cookies in the morning at the Cable Car Bake Shop for 10 Euros which heated us up in the biting cold. Never underestimate the cold here, it is bitter and really chills you through. Later we had some fries at the Chalet de la Marionette, one of the few cafes where you can buy individual items instead of a full set menu..... this is difficult usually as it's very much burger, nuggets etc which doesn't work well if you have vegetarians in your group. So healthy eating wasn't a feature of the day.....Later on, we realised that Peter Pan was operational again so we joined a long queue. It was bitterly cold by then so I left my daughters waiting for the ride and I headed off for a coffee back to the Cable Car Bake Shop. I was aware that a man was standing right up against me, far too close to me in the queue, So I paid for my drink and sat down at a table, opened my bag to check everything and of course my purse had been stolen with cards and cash all gone. Yes, by the puffa jacketed dodgy Eastern European in the queue. So the evening ended in City Hall, reporting the loss, with a snowball's chance in Hell at getting anything back.

After visiting the LA park earlier this year, i was exited to be in DIsneyland again abit its European sister. But was disappointed form the moment we arrived to hear that nearly half the attractions where closed and there was nothing new since my last visit 5 years a go.The problems with Disneyland:   Rides: There is not enough. Unlike the LA park which is packed to the rim with attractions, Paris has the same old tired rides. They need dramatically updating, for example Star Wars in on the OLD version still, And there was so little rides for the amount you pay which lead to...  Q times. Because of the lack of rides there was outrageous queue times of over a hour for everything in the park. Even though the park was not busy (i'm talking about a quarter capacity). This is either because of the lack of rides or high capacity rides, and the lack of...  Shows. There was none, Literally 0. Its cold (or hot if your lucky) and you want to sit down for half a hour in a warm place watching a show... tough. There is none. No 4D experiences like its sister parks (the muppets) or live shows (festival of the lion king)... nothing.  Prices. The whole park is just a joke.   4 for a coke,   4 for a coffee,   70 for a hoodie, Who pays these stupid prices. They was laughable at times. That on top of your overpriced ticket and hotel it all adds up wishing you went to Disney World instead.   Staff. Simply there was none. No one at the info board, no one with the character to talk to the kids. Two staff running a ride leading to slow boarding times. It was obvious the whole park was understaffed. GOOD POINTS  The Disney Dreams show. A mix of fireworks, projections and water in front of the amazing castle. What more could you want. The show is truly amazing and gives you shivers every time (and that was not just the snow we had).   The theme. The d  cor is great at DLP and carried out well through the whole site.   The staff. Even though there was a lack of staff, the ones there where present and helpful. So, if you are wanting a cheap Disney trip... think again.

I've been fortunate enough to visit all the Disneylands so my review is relative to the other parks. If I have to compare I would rate the Paris disneyland on the bottom part. It's still disneyland with most of the funfare which only a disney park can bring but in terms of service it was well below par. There were a lot of attractions that were close. Also, almost half of the food stall on the park seemed close and on the main food court there was a long queue on the line since there was only cashier open to accommodate all the guests. They could have at least added an additional staff there. I'm not sure if it's because it was a weekday or if because there was a slight snow during the morning but it still doesn't excuse the other food stalls to be close (I would understand some of the attractions closed if there are snows or rains). If this is a normal practice by the management on weekdays or low volume days then they should at least cut some of the rate their charging. Btw, I've been to other disney parks on weekdays and never had this experience. The other two things that really disappointed me is that they seem to allow or are very lax on smoking in the park. I actually saw a lot of people and even mothers smoking in the park (while on queue, walking on the park, etc). You would expect the Park management would be strict about this given it's a children's park for crying out loud. The other major disappointment is that it felt to me in general (not all though) the staffs didn't show that usual hospitability and approachability that all disney staffs are known for. I asked a staff for some direction and didn't even bother to look at me much more smile. I felt that he's not really in to his work. Even some of the staffs who help on managing the people during the parades were not smiling.

Fortunately it gave us a chance to defrost (toes had become numb waiting for Dumbo) and for the kids to share a sandwich for lunch.Captain EO deserves a mention as the most ridiculously absurd time waster of the lot. Don't go there. It's a Small World was a favourite with the kids..and even I found it mildly entertaining..and as there was no queue we did it twice. Phantom Manor and Peter Pan were hmmmm....OK, pas plus. Space Mountain was not my cup of tea, but my husband loved it....fast and furious!The 5pm parade was nice for our 4 year old....2 year old was fast asleep by that time...but not exactly outstanding. What I found most intriguing was how the dancers and characters managed to look so genuinely enthusiastic and cheerful despite having to leap about in the freezing cold singing something about 20 years of Disney magic, knowing they have to do it day in, day out......and are more than likely paid a pittance for it.On the up side, the park was clean and I found the staff we dealt with to be pleasant enough. I certainly wouldn't ever return....unless my children begged and pleaded with me to...when they're quite a bit older.We paid 70    for the 4 of us on a weekday...the 2 year old of course being free...& the 4 year old having free admission as part of the 'buy one adult get one child free' deal. So essentially my husband & I paid 35    each for the day in Disney Village. I believe the usual price for a non dated ticket is 60 or 70    per adult.

We did not expect that throughout our visit we would NOT have seen any characters around the parc. It was disgraceful that the management could not have made alternative arrangements for children to meet the characters   for example there are plenty of areas that are dry and they could have wandered around. Or as an alternative they could have put up tents at the meeting points. We also paid for a meal at Cafe Mickey where you are supposed to meet the characters, and yes we did but again only the same 4 were around, so again I would say if they were not in the parc where are the others? and why were they not in the restaurant?

Fast lanes were existing, but some of them were closed. Even Mickey and his friends were not seen   might have been too cold for them.There are on every corner shops to buy these nice little fancy dresses, cups, costumes and other plastic trash, more shops than rides.The only good thing is that it is nearby Paris.

OK, so we arrived by train from central Paris bang on 10am   about a 50 minute journey   and quickly passed through the security scanning. We'd bought our tickets online in advance so we didn't have to queue for them and we made our way to entrance where we were quickly scanned into the park.The first impression was that this was going to be everything that was promised with a large sign illuminated with fairy lights leaving you in no doubt where you were and celebrating 20 years of Disneyland Paris. You went under the sign and the view opened up to Main Street USA with Sleeping Beauty's Castle at the end, possibly one of the iconic images of the Disneyland Parks which even on an overcast December day didn't fail to impress and make me to revert to a giddy child when mixed with the jingly jangly festive music...Unfortunately this wasn't going to last. We decided to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride first so made our way across the park only to be told that it wasn't currently operating due to a 'technical problem' although it may be opened later. Disappointed we headed over to the other big ride in that area, the Indiana Jones Temple of Peril only to find the familiar park staff blocking the way and when questioned we were again informed that the attraction was closed due to 'technical problems', when questioned whether any rides were actually operating I received a shrug in response. The magic of Disney was quickly fading.Every ride had queues and, speaking to my partner, a lot of them seemed to be pretty poor relations to their UK cousins.

The ability to get on rides in minutes was in reality about a 20 minute wait rather than the 60   90 minutes it would have been otherwise but you often had a hour plus between getting the pass and your time slot opening.I expected people in Disney costumes to be everywhere but in reality we only saw Goofy and apart from on the rides there wasn't really anyone 'in character'.My disappointment as a first (and probably last) time visitor for Disney was compounded by the fact that my partners expectations as a previous visitor were so high.

However, what goes on here is over the top, bordering on extortion. Hot water and a Tea Bag (not a good brand, either), well over 3 EUR, Bottle of Diet Coke for 4, Beer for 7?

The staff in the park are extremely rude! obvioulsly not lovers of their jobs and not afraid to show it! No smiley friendly faces anywhere, with the exception of one older man in the Christmas wonderland area, who was actually very nice to our family. The 2 parks themselves are very nice with a good choice of rides and the usual parades, but it was extremely busy for November. The wait times were ridiculous, some up to 90 mins (not expected at this time of year), and the amount of times that the rides had  broken down  were beyond belief. i began to wonder if they were just trying to cut down on costs by having them out of action for various periods during the day. It didnt help when they let rides go half empty, no single riders etc to speed up queues. Character greeetings had no structure what so ever. A character would appear, no ropes to line up and wait your turn to have your photos, autograph books signed, it was a matter of french people first by pushing others out of the way and everyone waiting for a chance to push in to the scrum!

1480,145651842,2,2012-11,France,"OBJECTIVE REVIEW FROM ANNUAL PASS HOLDER   TOP TIPS: PLEASE READWe were annual pass holders for this park for a few consecutive years because we live close by, so my review is based on many visits. We are no longer frequent visitors mainly because of the following three reasons:1) the park is relatively small compared to the USA with fewer attractions, yet the park welcomes many visitors daily and wait times can be very long during school holidays (most summer, December) and weekends with average waits 25 90 minutes for most attractions. The worst rides are always Thunder Mountain and the Nemo coaster. It's difficult to find days that are quiet (usually limited to some wintry week days in Jan Feb)2) often the waiting lines are poorly managed and it is not unusual for parallel lines to move at significantly different speeds. Picking the right one requires some luck. This in combination with sometimes rude visitors cutting lines, pushing etc, has often caused us much frustration. 3) the worst thing is many many people smoking in the park, everywhere, all the time. There are constantly clouds of tobacco smoke drifting across your walking path. Smoking is not allowed in lines, but it's not really enforced. Just recently, I had a big argument with a visitor who flatly refused to put out their cigarette in a line, among children. On another occasion, I had to alert management of a group of teenage girls smoking marihuana in a line. I blame management for this as there should be a blanket ban that is continuously enforced, with widespread signs. Based on that, I feel the park deserves no more than one star, but my review has to stay objective and there are certainly also some good points about the park (beautifully landscaped, beautiful Cinderella castle, Nemo coaster)TOP TIPS:1) bear in mind the above points, so you are prepared. If possible, best to avoid visiting around any school holidays, the summer and weekends2) regardless, arrive either very early or arrive late to leave late during extended opening hours (weekends, summers). Waiting times drop off significantly a few hours before late closing hours as people get tired. Even better to split the day in two or visit 1 2 days several days. It's not an endurance race. Kids (and adults) get tired and cranky3) Walt Disney Studio's are fairly small but have some good attractions (Tower of Terror, Lilo & Stitch show, Nemo Coaster, Playhouse Disney show, Toystory land)4) get a fast pass as soon as you arrive (Thundermountain is a good bet). You can only get a fast pass for another attraction after the time has lapsed on the first one. No fast passes at Studio's.5) waiting time for the Nemo coaster at Walt Disney's studio's are usually long all day long, there is little point in postponing the wait. It's a very nice ride, worth the wait. Probably best for first thing in the morning6) quality of the food is not great and expensive. Best bets are the Hakuma Matata (fast food) or Blue Lagoon (table service, expensive). 7) if you are tired of the lines, try the slow train ride around the park, the steam boat, Adventure Island. Also, Phantom Manor's waiting times are also usually reasonable.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Our impression was that the management doesn't bother to do anything about this deliberately, as they prefer their fraud victims to return the next day to spend again many hours in the endless queus.The  Fast pass  system also sucks   who is going to wait for his queue for  Peter Pan  at 8:50 PM if he gets the card at 3 PM, and can't get any other  fast pass  until then ?Do not go there, at least not in August and school vacations.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

1488,144495909,1,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Really disappointing. A real surprise that it was so bad: poor on any absoilute scale and utterly shocking that Disney of all companies would tolerate such appalling standards.When we went to Disney in USA I was blown away by the professionalism & dedication to detail: friendly, clean, efficient   a lesson to people to learn from. None of that showed here, and it is a lesson only in the sense of things to avoid.Admittedly, it was half term & busy, it was a cold & rainy day, but still, that was a test   a test EuroDisney utterly, utterly failed.1) Lines for rides were very long. 1 2 hours. OK, so it happens but.....Disney is famous for its management of expectations: you see a clock saying  70 minutes wait  and I know this, so I think  60 minutes . When it is nearer 100 minutes I am staggered: not only by the actual wait but that expectation management has gone s o o o wrong.2) This is why they have FASTPASS. But the machines didn't work.Specificaly, they couldn't read the bar codes from online tickets.Long, long lines, and one poor cast member running around doing it by hand...3) Which was a consistent theme.Everywhere was understaffed. Long lines, long waits, harrassed staff.Awful.4) Some of the rides were broken. There are not *that* many so if one of the big rides ( Rock & Roller Coaster ) closes, that spills over.5) The food was *DIRE*. This is Paris: you have to search out bad food, but  boy  Disney managed it!!Waiting 40 minutes for an expensive plate of sub KFC fast food...Inedible, disgusting. Even our kids (who normally eat everything and who have mno problems with fast food were not impressed. I found it literally indeible).6) It is eye wateringly expensive.    9 for a tub of bad popcorn, incredibly expensive fast food.7) Where were the cast (1) ?The rides & concessions were understaffed, but where were the  helpers ? I don't think I saw a cast member.Again, in USA I remember being overwhemled by how many, how helpful people. Not a soul...8) Where were the cast (2) ?Where was Mickey, Buzz, Princesses, etc etc etc.Several small children were asking puzzled: they'd been promised to see them   but no one....9) Not to mention no parade, no fireworks...Paradoxical because it was Guy Fawkes w end in UK but nothing.10) Had anyone from Disney noticed they were in Paris, not in CA or FL?Has no one mentioned this in 20 years?It was cold & rainy.But that is not a surprise: the city has the same weather most years & it will rain. So plan ahead....Building a shelter to protect people as they wait in line for 2 hours is not that had: the concept of  a roof  has been known to architects for several thousand years.There were precious few places to shelter from the rain, and even fewer where you could warm up    all imppossibly crowded.The lines were cold & with rain pouring downIf this were  No Name Theme Park  I would have thought it was rubbish, serves us right for going, but what do you expect....But from Disney? Disney !!?? The company famous for professionalism, dedication to detail, micro management...???I don't own shares but if I did I would sell: this is a sign of a company that has majorly lost the plot.In the mean time, there are better theme parks in Europe (or maybe as bad, but cheaper & with lower expectations)   or save up and go to CA or FL.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1489,144394794,1,2012-11,France,"I took my son to Disneyland Paris two days ago. I wanted to have a special mother son day, and in his eyes, we probably did. BUT for such a highly reputed theme park, I have a hard time believing the good reviews. I've been living in France for 9 years and I fully understand that it is VERY hard to train French people about the hospitality industry, what the difference is between good service and bad. But the workers for the most part were unhappy in their own lives (maybe can't blame them if they're working at Disney), and not afraid to show it. I would like to think Disney has the means to train employees on being friendly, or even how to fake being friendly.That said   there is a system called  Fast Pass,  which did eliminate some of the queing time. But it was quite inefficient and had some restrictions. Inefficient because they would tell you to come back between 2   5 hours!! And you couldn't use it for more than 1 or 2 rides at a time. Now the biggest disappoinment to me was the FOOD. Never in my life, even from my simple grocer cheap discount food, have I had such terrible, awful food. The exception was the popcorn and candy apples. Every restaurant offered the same  American  fare, that was so flavorless that stating it  left a lot to be desired  would be a severe understatement. I am not a 5 star luxury diner and not someone who has the highest expectations either. I am a regular lower middle class person. But I would not be surprised AT ALL if the food they serve you comes from the same factory that prepares DOG FOOD. And maybe it's even below that. I mean really, Disney, how do you get away with that? OMG, my son loves  Ribs  and when we went to the  Western  style restaurant and he ordered ribs I thought he was being picky until I cut into them and tasted them. First of all, 90% of the  ribs  were blubber layered over a bone. What little meat there was, tasted like boiled mush   literally. They are serving premade microwave meals and I can tell you, with all honesty, that they are as low of quality as you can find. But you will pay a premium price for it. I am ready to write to Disney myself about this matter, because I would think a corporation with such a reputation would want to please their guests. However, this was just beyond disappointing. It was just flat out disgusting. Keep in mind, I am NOT a picky person!!! We also had a hotdog that tasted as if it were boiled beyond oblivion. I mean really, how hard is it to make a simple hotdog. I can do that myself with the cheapest hot dogs from the grocery store and it will taste better. I realize some people are just of a complaining nature and nothing is ever good enough. But this is why you should listen to my review, because I am not one of these. This is why I am writing this, because I really think you should read my warning, and I hope the people at Disney have a look at these reviews every once in a while too.In addition, I'm sorry, but there were a number of E. European guests who lack what W. Europeans would call manners. And then you have the French teenie boppers who are in heat in line behind you about to have sex while waiting. No discretion for public displays of affection.The Buzz Lightyear ride did have technical probs. And so did Indiana Jones, after we waited for 45 min. in line (posted waiting time was 30 min), then they told us it would be at least another 30 min and we left. It is just very, very tiresome to walk around with these huge crowds and stand in line for so many hours. I would suggest that Disney 1. outsources food services if they're incapable of delivering anything decent. 2. Set a maximum capacity for the park so that it isn't overcrowded and the guests can enjoy it.One last bad point   You know Paris has the same weather as London, right? Well you probably don't. I didn't. Now that I've been living here for 9 years, I can assure you that they might have 10% less rain, but that's it. It rains here nonstop. And it's very cold most of the year. You might have a 1 month window of good weather. But I'm sure the crowds during this period are intolerable. So I would just suggest avoiding this park at all costs. You would probably have a better time at one of the real Disney parks in the US if you can manage to save up enough to get over there.Hope this helped",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We arrived around 5pm as we wanted to avoid the crowds, waited in line, got the 1 day tickets for two parks, cost almost   250. On arrival the kids were blown away by both Cinderellas Castle and unbelievably Pirates of the Caribbean ride had hardly any queues at all, so far so good! Unfortunately things took a turn for the worst when we quickly realised that as the clock reached 6.30pm certain attractions were being rapidly shut down. By 7pm there was nothing open that the kids could go on (neither are big enough for the roller coaster rides), so we decided we would go visit the second park, only to find it was closed! Now, let's point out here that at no point at the ticket kiosk were we informed that the second park closed at a certain time, no they were quite happy to sell the 2 park tickets to us, tickets that were completely useless.Needless to say the only places open were the horrible food joints which were in total carnage and the retail outlets (surprise, surprise). Of course we had to eat somewhere as the kids were starving, and just when you thought the night couldn't get any worse along came Planet Hollywood! Yes, we should have known better, but hope springs eternal and none of the other food outlets were particularly inspiring. Let me just advise others, please do yourselves a favour and just go to the McDonalds a couple of doors down, because compared to Planet Hollywood it is a Michelin Star restaurant.

Far too many rides and food outlets were closed, frustrating a lot of people. Rides also breaking down too much. Before going I doubted the French' ability to emulate their parent company's country's ability to host such an enterprise.

On the Disney channel in room one of the claims was that you can relax as all the on park transport is free, well no it isn't, some is but the train that takes you from your accommodation to the park entrance is 2 euros per person. Not in the Disney spirit at all. As for the breakfast experience at the lodge, despite the genuine and good natured efforts of the far too many black faces that do the menial work, the experience is one of being cattle herded.

We only have memories of happy times.We knew August would be busy at EuroDisney so expected the queues for the rides and that the parks would be very crowded. Nothing prepared us for the amount of pushing, shoving and queue jumping. The restaurant food was terrible and the toilets were stinking.However, we had two really bad moments:The first was buying a Yearly Pass. The queue at the Annual Passport Office took 2 hours, despite the girl saying it would take 20 minutes. They are fanatical about you leaving buggies outside for Health & Safety reasons. They repeatedly asked us to do so, but we refused until we were close to the doors of the Annual Passport Office. When we eventually put the buggy with the others outside, our 2 year old daughter began to scream ...and scream ...and scream. She is in the Terrible Twos after all. We had one French man shouting abuse at us about her screaming. Inside we decided to complain about the long wait. The girl on the desk said   what do you expect, it's August!  We asked to see a manager, but she was another member of staff with an attitude problem. Basically they laughed in our faces. You pay a lot of money for Annual Passes and we expected administration to be fast, it isn't. What a waste of 2 valuable hours in the Parks.2) We came out of the Peter Pan ride late in the evening and decided to join the people gathering for the late night show. What a mistake! It became incredibly crowded in the area by the castle. Eventually there was absolutely no room to move. We were starting to get fairly worried by the pushing and shoving going on. On the one hand EuroDisney go on about not taking buggies into the Annual Passport OIffice for Health & Safety reasons, but people were trying to run us over with their buggies, so that they could get a better view. EuroDisney needs to take a good look at its crowd control, especially when you cannot see much in the dark. We would have liked to leave because we felt so uncomfortable in the crowd, but there was no room to move to exit.The only redeeming feature of the whole 4 days at EuroDisney was the parade at 7.00 pm, which was fantastic.

1508,139331058,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We booked a week at Disney this summer, we were made up of my step mum, her sister, there three young children, my brother and my girlfriend. We have all been to Disneyland Paris before and had a great time and given the price and reputation of the park you wouldn't expect anything less!When we entered the park we were overcome by the amount of people that were being allowed into the park, I realise its summer but it was unbearable, it soon became clear that profit is the only thing that seems to matter here now! The fast pass machines were mostly broken and even if you did manage to get a ticket from one you will likely be waiting 3 5 hours before you can use it, or of course you can queue for 70 90 mins, the staff are rude and dismissive and very unsympathetic.We even resorted to using the arcade to pass time only to find most of the machines were broken or completely out of order although you have to put you money in to find out which ones!We didn't want to chance having a bad meal to top this all of so we booked 2 days in advance to eat at the blue lagoon restaurant inside the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' ride. It turns out if you like eating food in the evening like a normal human being you will have to book at least the day before for more or less any restaurant in the park. When we eventually had our meal they squashed all 8 of us round 2 tiny tables in a corridor 40 mins late! I would not exaggerate for effect but this was one of the worst meals I have ever had, we were so shocked, I complained about the table size and location and that one of the seats was covered in beer but it would have been pointless to complain about the meal! I wouldn't have known what to say. It was laughably bad and cost us    300.I could go on and on but to sum it all up none of us will ever be going back to Disneyland Paris, I feel betrayed and angry as I have recommended it so many times before and have fond memories of it from when I was younger. I hope our experience was unusual and that anyone going has a great time but if you are thinking about it I strongly suggest you think carefully about what kind of company you're going to give your hard earned money to and if your kids really are going to have a 'magical' experience.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1509,139304603,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Eurodisney was born into a privileged family of Disney Success in 1992 and followed on from a long line of highly successful and popular theme park resorts.Unfortunately it hit trouble almost straight away from its opening with numerous labour problems and losses that gave its American creators their first taste of loss related sleepless nights.The huge beast of a theme park that greeted us on our arrival is very much the product of this troubled history...it has to make money and it is unwilling to compromise on this even if its going to spoil your day.Almost without fail, if you read any of the Eurodisney reviews, the major complaints are the eye wateringly high prices that you will encounter for everyday items such as bottled water.The location of the park makes it virtually impossible to visit anything other than a Disney related venue or Hotel to eat and drink so there is there is a definate feeling that your being held hostage.The Park absorbs a huge number of people each day and I got the feeling that whilst I was there (Late August) it was not always able to cope with the vast swaythe of humanity that filled its every corner.Consequently the infamous queues become the major events that eat into your day...sometimes for up to 90 minutes for the major rides. A strange psychological effect also seems to kick in once youve been in the park and you become fully engaged in the 'queue to enjoy' mentality....you actually start to wait in huge lines of people to get on rides that are fully visible and which are obviously not that good....this happened to us...and we waited 45 mins for a 60 second ride on the buzz lightyear 'orbitron' which was nothing more than a basic 10 gondola carousel that can be found at any Fairground.Much has been written about the Staff at Disneyland....our experiences were positive when you consider that they have a hugh 'people' workload to deal with.Many reviewers comment that the Staff are Hostile if you dont make an effort to speak a bit of French....this is Pathetic and not true...Disneyland is a multi cultural and Multi Nationality experience and the Staff are mostly very comfortable with this.Eurodisney cost $4 Billion to build and this can be seen in the amazing attention to detail on decor, design and finishing touches which truly continue the Walt Disney 'Quality' Philosophy...unfortunately its in the operational aspects that I felt the whole experience at times felt like a failure....at times just the little things that spoilt the illusion...like cobwebs on the exquisitely detailed figures in the 'Its A Small World' ride or the rust stained hands and clothing that we all picked up from walking down the spiral staircase of the Cinderella Castle which was in almost complete darkness and highly dangerous to both young and old to navigate down.And the Good?....there is an event currently running that re awakens the spirit of Disney for all who see it...and even after all the open arguing that we witnessed between people fighting for good viewpoints for them and their children we were all in silent awe at the Disney Dreams 20th anniversary show.The show has been created to celebrate the 20 years of Eurodisney and uses hugely powerful projectors to turn the cinderella castle into a multicoloured canvas for a celebration of the Disney that was (Not is!). Absolutely NO expense has been spared here.The projections are combined with pyrotechnics and hugh moving fountain jets and also spray projections (Images projected onto hugh plumes of fine water jets)....but thats not all...the Disney team have also combined numerous multi colour multi beam laser projections into the show with additional high power moving sky beam spotlights and amazing huge multiple jets of fire that you can actually feel burn your face from more than 100 metres away. All these elements are not just fired off randomly...they are syncronised to all your favourite Disney music and work together to pull off a truly amazing 20 minute show.At the end of the evening we joined the numerous tens of thousands of other people leaving the park and for just a minute it felt like we had all forgiven Eurodisney for its many imperfections in favour of a single event that had moved us and made us rediscover our long lost Disney Dream.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I went with my two youngest daughters (who regarded it as a trip of a lifetime) and was expecting a general standard comparable with other family focused entertainment. To enter there was a queue (or more accurately a jostling crowd) waiting for over 90 minutes in the hot sun with no shelter, drinks or entertainment (09:00 10:30). Only when we got to the gates that we found that this was the bag check (there was no way of knowing this or indeed of getting through   although bigger adults were shoving past smaller children I think they still only gained 15 20 mins). After that the ticket queue began which was an additional 60 minutes complete with ticket touts (or rather scammers   they did not actually have any tickets   just wanted money). Shelter from the sun at least, but no food, drinks or entertainment   very tough on a five year old and nine year old   and plenty of  attitude  from the staff who I think resent having to work in somewhere like this.

1511,139160342,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We stayed at Disneyland Paris for 3 days at the end of August and it will definitely be our last visit. We had booked into the Sante Fe Hotel   absolutely dreadful in every respect   in order to benefit from the Magic Hours. However, the number of rides which were not working during the Magic Hours meant the few rides which were working were as overcrowded as at the busiest time of the day. And, of course, it was the most poplar rides which were out of order most frequently.There was no information about what was supposed to be happening after 21.00 and despite waiting until 22.10 for something   anything   to happen on our first evening, we were disappointed and returned to our hotel without knowing what we would miss. I asked a cast member but she seemed as lost as I was.A number of the more popular rides broke down fairly frequently during park opening hours, too. The Fast Pass machines were almost always out of order and led to at least one punch up between customers that I witnessed   nice for my children to see. One machine for the Star Tours ride dispensed one FP followed by an invalid ticket, only to dispense another valid FP followed by an invalid ticket to the next customer. This meant people could not get more FPs as some of their tickets had registered correctly. I gave away the FP I got as I couldn't allow my 11 year old to go on without an adult and try as I might, the FP machine would not accept a second ticket from me. There was rarely a cast members to ask for help. The queues were extremely long and the waiting times given were not accurate.On our day at the Studios, we went immediately to Crush's Coaster, 20 minutes before the park was due to open. The queue was already 45 minutes long and by the time we were half way through an announcement was made to say the ride completely full. I am still unsure what was meant by this but it seemed to imply that the nobody else was allowed to join the existing queue.I cannot fault the cast members who took the roles of the various Disney Characters; they were absolutely marvellous and delighted my six year old niece. The people in the restaurants made an effort to deal with the dairy allergy of one of our group, although they had generally run out of the allergy menu. It was a far cry from Florida where the dairy allergic menu was amazing.The hotel fell far short of our expectations. We have stayed at Disney Hotels in the past and have always been delighted with the accommodation. This time was totally different: the beds were so uncomfortable, my son elected to sleep on the floor: he was the only one who got a decent night's sleep. There was nowhere to hang the hand towels in the bathroom and both of our rooms stank. This was a huge disappointment to us. I have always loved Disney but the Paris Park seems very run down.

I am very disappointed in DIsneyland Paris and would highly suggest they go to Florida for training in how to run a park, motivate staff, keep the parks clean and bring back the magic. One of the first things I noticed was the toilets throughout the park stunk of strong urine, they were very dirty and never did I see staff cleaning them. The park in general was dirty and people were smoking everywhere, no one ever approached them and told them to smoke in the designated areas. I got two fast tracks for two different rides and when it was time to use them both the rides were closed due to technical issues. I only saw Peter pan and Wendy walking around the park and even then they only spoke to each other, they didn't acknowledge anyone around them. The food is like cardboard and exspensive. The place was very cramped and it was hard to find somewhere to sit. Trying to get into the park took ages as the only open about 40 percent of the ticket booths. The lockers didn't work either. I visited DIsney Paris 10 years ago and is was clean and magical, now it's just a dirty park with no spark, staff and management have lost their mojo! my sister was going to book for next year but I have told the family not to bother, instead we are going to save up for Florida and take the kids to where the real magic is.

We are normally positive people and look for the good things but we really struggled with this. We knew it was going to be busy but I have been before in August and I am sure this time they have legally let too many people in! The queues were unbelievable (what they need are more fast pass rides), the amount of rude people was overwhelming (my little boy was getting quite upset at this) and smokers were everywhere (where were the designated smoking areas). However, what ruined it for us was the extortionate price of everything.

1518,138896758,2,2012-8,Italy,"Have been to Disneyland Paris in mid August, and the park is simply not worth the effort, for 3 main reasons:1) Crowd: although I am aware that August attracts the most people, the crowd and   even more important   the lines to ride the various attractions were just crazy. We basically rode on not more than 5 6 attractions in an entire day, with lines up to 1.5 hours, especially for the most thrilling ones, like Big Thunder Mountain (though more or less that's the same even for other activities   the wait time for children to meet and have a photo with Disney princesses was indicated as 75 mins!2) Overpriced: everything, from the entrance (more than 60    ) to food and souvenirs has just too high a price   again, of course all parks have more or less the same attitude, but spending more than 6 euros for an hot dog (scarse quality bread and a wurstel) is just as crazy3) For 2 (two!) times in a day, rides failed while we were in line (Pirates and Big Thunder Mountain). The result? After spending 30 mins waiting, we had to come back later, of course with double the people in queue   and more hours thrown away. Maybe it was an unlucky day, but I wouldn't be so sure..Conclusion: probably kids will love the setting (I admit it was truly beautiful, pure Disney universe) but the rides for adults are very very limited in number (their  ghost house  wouldn't scare a first grader I'd say), let alone the time spent in line, from tickets to rides to have lunch.Not worth it.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

No free wifi ( most basic hotels now have it for free) It is there but you have to pay.No coffee or tea making facilities in room. Most basic hotels have this also.long wait for breakfast in a morning.Was given a breakfast voucher to use in the park for 8.15am wich says on it character breakfast.Be warned it is not. It is a a way of getting people away from the hotel to cut numbers down for breakfast time.But they do not tell you this. So after getting up very early and get the two boys ready and walk about a mile to the restaurant in the park expecting to see characters and non turn up. We wasnt amused.Meal vouchers were okay but be warned you may still have to pay extra in some places.I paid   35 extra in one place including the vouchers.The park parades have been shortened and do not stop to get out and dance etc.These are now to worth waiting for.Do not do a daytime one then a night time parade either now.Just one at 7.00 pm in disney and 5.00 pm in mgm.ride wait times are about 1hr to 1.30 hrs just to go on basic rides.When they can open both sides or lanes on some rides but are not doing it.Characters are about but alot less than before.Overall we were very disappionted from last time.I think france just want your money and are not bothered.

Rude staff, rude people, no magic at all!!Booked a 4 night 5 day stay at Newport Bay as a package through Disney 24th 28th August 2012 for myself, my husband and two teenage daughters. This was our first trip to Disneyland Paris although we have experienced Disney in Florida 5 times. We should have by passed Paris and made it 6! However we thought we'd give it a go with open minds not expecting an exact replica of our fabulous American experiences but at least something akin to them. How wrong we were! The French staff were rude and arrogant as were the people visiting the parks. Numerous times myself and other family members were elbowed or shouldered out of the way without apology. They did not seem to know how to go around you,prefering instead to aim straight for you! None of the staff manning the rides showed any enthusiasm for how they were dressed or where they were, this is Disney for goodness sake,get into character or at least smile!! Forget meeting the characters as it's a general free for all with no staff organising queues and offering to take your picture unlike Florida.On our last night we pre booked a meal in The Blue Lagoon inside the Pirates of The Carribean ride for 9pm . We were 'greeted' at the door by a surly man who informed us the restaurant was closed due to technical difficulties with the ride which made little sense. However there was no attempt to book us in anywhere else, just a shrug of the shoulders as he stepped back at gazed into the distance. I've not experienced that attitude anywhere and was the last thing i expected from Disney. We made our way across a now extra crowded park as people were lining the parade route to City Hall where we were told by another arrogant surly indifferent staff member that every restaurant in the park was booked.On another occasion we we shouted at by a staff member from across the park waving her arms frantically and shaking her head manically because she wanted us to move, polite,not!Park presentation and cleanliness was also an issue for us . Most of the toilets were not cleaned regularly so were messy and smelt bad,with at least 2 in each being unusable because of overflowing or general disgustingness. Although smoking is only supposed to be in designated areas as in Florida, in Paris this is not adhered to,with people even smoking in the queues and no staff monitoring it.This of course meant fag butts eveywhere as well. Night time signage needed checking also with lots of random large Disney letter signage out. For eg the World of Disney shop spelt out WORNEY with the missing letters unlit!On a more complimentary note we were impressed by the variety and quality of food available.We had booked a deal staying at the Disney Newport Bay hotel with all meals included, 4 nights 5 days for four of us for   1400(not inc flight) and considering the food alone would have cost us   900 this i thought was good. The rides and shows were all of Disney standard with reasonable wait times considering the time of year.Some of my points may seem a little picky but considering the Disney corporation push the magical experience theme (which doesn't come cheap) in my opinion that's what they should deliver regardless of which country it's in.

1522,138520058,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"When one thinks of 'Disneyland Paris', one sees a true haven, heaven for the kids with magic bouncing off the walls like rainbows after sunlight breaks through a monsoon, and a place for adults to also, somehow get enjoyment out of the place too, and you all go skipping down the promenade holding hands while some beautiful music softly plays out of the tannoys.Stop right there, my friend. This is all a dream. Welcome to reality, and Disneyland Paris just doesn't cut it. We as a family, me aged 17, my sister aged 5, and my mum and stepdad went out there for a two day break (Friday and Saturday), as we were travelling from Center Parcs near to Laon on the Friday, the first day was really just a half day as we needed to do the one million things that come along with travelling and arriving. But enough of the tangent, this is our experience.We arrived on Friday afternoon, and we went in straight away after parking the car. Little did we know that there was going to be a huge walk to actually get into the park, even when you're parked in 'Zone A'. Annoying. However the travellators do take some of the weight off of your feet but only temporarily as more pressure is piled on when you hear the out of date, tacky music that is played at probably 100dB right above your ears when entering the park, of which I'm sure is a health and safety risk. Oh and how could I forget? Every minute or so a 'Welcome' message is played as well! A nausiating voice, in French and English will annoy you hugely while you enter. You'll probably be able to recite the lines upon entry, and not just in English!About the park, I feel over the years it has been slowly let to become just a generally tacky place, and what I find interesting is that this year it's the 'Twenty year celebrations', and part of me wonders if some of the places haven't been seen to since 1992! The rides, however are actually quite good and still cater for all of the age groups, for example children can still live out dreams in 'Fantasyland', whether they are male or female, or the boys can pretend they're still a cowboy in the 'Wild Wild West', in 'Frontierland', yee haw. These are just to name a few of the fantasies that can be lived out by your children, but it comes at a price..Example, take the image that I have just shown you, go on imagine it, you have my permission. Okay, now add lots of people. No no, more than that. Nope, still more than that! Okay if you need an idea, just add everyone who visits Oxford Street, Westfield London West and Westfield Stratford, on a Saturday, in the school holidays. Bingo! You've got enough people now in this vision. Make sure you've got enough crying babies, toddlers, screaming parents and arguments galore, add a hot Summer's day if you wish and your image is complete. Serve with a garnish of stress. This, dear reader is how crowded the place gets. I can understand why though, but there are limits, and I fear that this is the limit. The sheer volume of people on the site at one time can be bordering among the dangerous, an example of this being every five seconds, you are bound to hit another family and be saying 'Sorry' in about seven different languages. If you have small children also, well this can be made even worse, as some people I saw in the park completely disregard anyone, and your child, or children for that matter stand a high risk of ending up in the back of an ambulance after 'Mr. I don't care about anyone within a 100m radius of me' knocks into you, or your child, causing distress and injury. Getting onto any ride, even past ten 'o' clock is misery served on ice. What is even worse is the fact that some people have the cheek to push past you in the queues! This happened to me, as first hand experience and so I was in a battle for one space against four other people, in a queue. How sad it is. The average queue time for any ride after about an hour after opening is 60 minutes plus, sometimes even up to 90. So if you like queuing, by all means get down to Disneyland now! However, if you don't like most people..I want to move on now to the prices of some things once you're inside the park. To sum it up in a sentence, once you're in the park, you are essentially prisoner, at mercy to the owners of Disneyland. Bring half the contents of your bank account, because 98% of the time you'll be using it all up. Food there is a joke, to say the least. Unless you want to have a small bite and dare to venture into some of the 'themed' places Disneyland offer internally, you're going to be stung. Badly. A main meal? I know some places in London where you can get a good quality meal for   15 a head, sometimes more sometimes less dependent what you get, but all with plenty of food so you don't go home hungry. At Disneyland? Ahem. Just for a main meal, 20 euros minimum. Or if you look around and not eat as much, 10 and 14 euros as a bracket. You would expect the quality to be great wouldn't you considering the price? Think again. I forked out 14 euros for a pizza meal, of which promised me a four cheese pizza, a side salad, tiramisu and a drink. Anyone with the least of distingushed pallets could tell you that the pizza was probably made out of only two cheeses. And the quality of the rest of the food is just, to be frank dire for what one expects for the money. At least the tiramisu cheered me up a bit. 'Own some of the magic!' I hear Disney cry, now. What they don't mention is that to own 'some of the magic', you need to fork out pathetic amounts of money to actually obtain it. Items of clothing, if you expect to go there to buy some new clothes and bring not much else, you're going to be strutting around in your birthday suit, unless you have a golden credit card. A themed T Shirt, for example costed 35 euros. Excuse me? I could eat out with 'Mon amour' for cheaper! If I had one. Even a balloon with Mickey or Minnie Mouse on it costs 7.50 euros. How disgusting is that when you as an adult will fully know that the balloons probably get made for about seven cents! It's just sad though, I feel personally that Disney need to charge so much for everything once you're inside the park and it is a true disgrace.Lastly the parades, of which run nightly. Most nights, or even every night there is one parade at 7pm, of which features the main characters that Mr. Disney created many years ago, and also the masterminds of today. Be severely warned. I arranged to meet my mum and little sister near to the entrance of the park about ten minutes before the parade begun, as they had gone home for the afternoon and I wanted to sieze the opportunity to, hopefully be impressed by Disneyland that afternoon. I had to get back from one side of the park to the other to do so and as one expects, the journey shouldn't be too bad, right? Wrong. The time came around when I was to meet with my mum and sister, only to be met by a brick wall of, what felt like two thousand people, sealing off any exit point to attempt to get to my parents. I was lucky though, I got through in the end and this was for two reasons;1. I live near London, and I often spend a lot of time on the tube, meaning I'm used to the general commute and running through places at speed.2. I was on my own at that point.If I wasn't on my own, I wouldn't have made it back to my mum, purely because it would have been impossible circumnavigating a tide of stressed parents with small children, simple. Once I got back to my loving family, I was greeted with a sight where people had been sitting, or standing right against the kerb to get the best view of the men and women in funny costumes, of which was just amazing to see. Amazing for Disney, obviously as they are rolling in the money, amazing for me and my sister as she couldn't see anything, just a sea of legs and shorts. In theory this idea could work though of having so many people, and work quite well, but the staff just got it all wrong, encouraging people to stand up, and actually arguing with them if they didn't stand. It doesn't take a genius to work out that when you have that volume of people you can't have the first two rows of people standing! Pathetic. I felt the need to lift my sister onto my shoulders as I love her very much, like a brother should so that she could see everything, and she got the enjoyment out of it that she deserved. The sad fact is though is that they only had one parade on a day, at 7pm. I find this a bit sad as you should 'give something for the fans that paid to get in', and do more parades a day, please? For what you get, however if you do decide to fork out the money to come here it just doesn't step up to the mark. My sister was just overwhelmed by the amount of people that were in the park at one time, and in fact it was too much for her, and I just suspect some other young children would find the whole attraction too much. If you want to own some of the cheaply made magic that'll cost you 25 euros and last about a week, then go on. If you want to overpay for some cheap and nasty food where you're NOT allowed to have a picnic once inside the park, then go on. If you want a day where you'll be constantly bumped into, knocked out of the way or even onto the ground, where you're surrounded by children having tantrums because they can't have the candy floss which costs 4 euros, and then wait in a queue for a ride for 90 minutes that lasts 90 seconds, then go on! UK attractions such as 'Thorpe Park' and 'Alton Towers' have really overtaken Disneyland over the last five years, and unfortunately Disneyland has been left in the dust, coughing and spluttering.

The only Disney magic is that that you create yourself   it was seriously lacking. I did expect it to be busy but it was heaving. The late night parade and show were positively dangerous despite staff trying to keep order   i suppose its a financial thing  cutbacks mean less staff. Most of the staff lacked any enthusiasm anyway and didn' t keep any order so people pushed and shoved   very rude. All queuing signage was very very inaccurate   the first ride we tried said 15 mins and it was actually over an hour. The staff were just not paying attention and organising things. The toilets were disgusting   everyone i went in even in the morning they smelt. Food was ok but very expensive and again service was just not organised so queueing was a pain.

By this time we had lost the will to live.The park has far to many customer, the queues for food were so long we could not get any so ended up with a box of popcorn.The best part of the park was the lunch with the disney crew, but the food really was not good, i had fish and chips at 19Euros and really it was 2 fish fingers, my granddaughter had a mushroom pizza which consisted of a tomato base and raw mushrooms sprinkled on top. all in all i would not recommend anyone to go to Disneyland Paris, far to expensive and far to packed not VFM at all This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We stayed at the Santa Fe, which was basic, a bit tired looking(could have done with a repaint) but it was clean, rooms cleaned daily, fresh towels and toiletries provided daily. It went downhill from there. We had booked lunch with the characters at Disney Cowboy Cookout BBQ. Food was fairly poor quality, but hadn't really expected much better. We went with the intention of our children getting their autograph books signed. Got a few autographs and pictures, but Tigger (one of my son's (aged 2) favourites)missed out our table three times. When we went over, Tiggers minder said our kids have enough autographs and said we couldn't have Tiggers. My daughter (aged 7) then approached Tigger directly to politely ask him. Tiggers minder told him not to sign it so Tigger then shook his hands and refused, resulting in two very upset children. The next day we planned our day at the studios park, and reserved a table at Le Restaurant Des Stars. We sat down to eat our food and my daughter jumped out of her seat and announced there was a dead mouse under the table. We grabbed the kids, told the staff and demanded our half board meal vouchers back. The staff appeared surprised we wanted to leave the restaurant, but did return our vouchers. It was a  Ratatouille  themed restaurant, but a dead mouse was ridiculous!. (We have yet to try to claim the money back as you have to do that via email with a copy of your vouchers) we went later to report it to Guest Relations, who took a statement , and gave us vouchers for 2 balloons and 2 badges, and 2 passes for immediate boarding for 2 rides. Due to our lunch of crisps and popcorn ( we couldn't stomach anything else after the mouse incident) we were all really hungry so went back to the park for our dinner reservation at 8pm at Agrabah Cafe. We finally got seated at 8.20pm went to the buffet, but there was hardly any food left. When we questioned this, we were told they close at 8.30pm, and everybody was hungry today and they had run out of stock!

Here we believe we will find the same beauty, service, friendliness, and atmosphere we experience in Orlando Florida, after all it is a Disney brand location and that must mean the same Disney corporate structure and ideals that make us feel so welcome in Orlando. Alas, this is not the way it is overseas. We liked where the train station lets you off near the entrance, but the limited number of security guards checking bags, and ticket sales people, made for very long lines and the first hour there spent outside the park. We did get in, and are excited now as we look at the park from a distance, then we see the security guards in the park, intimidating and not happy. The employees overall were not excited to be there, or willing to go out of there way to help you. One thing that very quickly became clear is that this park does not spend enough of its budget cleaning. The table we sat at for lunch was wet from rain, we wiped it off several times before we got a clean towel, same with the seats. I looked around and saw cobwebs, no not planned ones, but real ones from lack of cleaning. The landscaping was not as crisp, trimmed or neat as Orlando either. Many floors have dust and dust bunnies growing on them. It is a shame that this kind of investment was made into the parks, and they spend the same effort cleaning it, as I did my own place when I was a 20 year old bachelor. Meaning not near enough. The crowds are much different as well. People do not yield at all. There are more frowns than smiles, unfortunately.

I just cannot understand the hype about it. We stayed in Paris travelling by metro to Marne La Vallee. These are our personal observations.1. Lack of staff   we spent some time in a separate part of the park looking for rides and were eventually told   you have to go to Disneyland  ( which was next door   we were in Studios and did not know it, no proper signs   see below). There was never anyone to ask for directions to coffee places and very importantly toilets and the rides. 2. Signage was amazingly poor   needs to be larger esp for toilets: you have to up on top of it to see it Maps very sketchy and not clear to me.3. Etiquette: as an example queuing an hour for Pirates of the Caribbean and sitting behind a woman who saw nothing but through the lens of her permanently flashing camera. Not Disneyland's   fault  but irksome nevertheless. 4. No giant MIckey Mouse s! Or other characters, as other reviewers have said, as in USA.5. Expense of very poor food: I prefer not to eat meat but not much choice here: one very thin beefburger and one hot dog cost over   15. And you had to queue for half an hour to get it in a cardboard tray.My overall impression was that this must be mass hypnosis. The child I was with said   one or two rides were good but the rest was rubbish . The very young children, the girls in their fairy land dresses, know no different. Good part? I was amused to hear that,   at least she can tell people she has been to Disneyland . Does this emperor have any clothes?.... If you want something a lot less than the (discounted!) fifty pounds each ticket, the very best option is Jardin d'Aclimatisation at Sablons, near La Defense ( best hotel is Frazer Hospitality a brillant new self catering with breakfast hotel) The Jardin has great rides at 3 euros each, free attractions, the occasional dromedary and other animals and snack foods costing less  La Plage   the Seine Beach in August   is free. And don;t let the language barrier put you off. But with small children and without a you may of course go for convenience. ...and maybe it is all about saying we have been to Disneyland? Brilliant marketing. I think it is a cynical rip off living off the very well promoted Disney name. Perhaps Disneyland belongs in America   and it is bigger there ( of course ) .

I am totally surprised that the Disney company has let this park become so shabby and incompetently run compared to their other parks. At first glance it looks like a great place but then you see all the cigarette butts littered in all the planters and on roof tops while waiting in lines at the attractions. Gum is also plastered on the ground in a lot of places yuk! Even though there are designated smoking areas people just smoke where they like even in the lines and the cast members do nothing about it. Several times people jumped the fences to sneak in line even older adults who should know better. The cast members in some of the stores are pretty useless. When we went into the Gibson Girl to get some sundaes there were about 8 9 cast members standing behind the counter with only 3 of them actually working. The others were chatting and leaning against the counter. After waiting about 10 minutes with the line hardly moving we left seriously how do they ever sell anything here. My daughter really wanted to eat at the  Restaurant des Stars  I shouldn't have relented the food was awful and cold a total waste of 53 euros. This was another place with a big line and tons of empty tables don't they want to fill them? it wasn't like there wasn't enough staff to man them all lol. Like others have mentioned the queues were terrible. We are pretty savvy at using fastpasses but even with them it was so difficult because staff members would cut the line off randomly or attractions would break down often. Also, on the Studio Tram Tour they wouldn't fill all the cars they would leave one or two empty and the line was huge.

We visited in July and the unbearable queues started just outside the train station. The first queue is a bag check   not sure what they were looking for but they did ask about our food   didn't take it away so I guess it's allowed. We still had to buy some of the nasty, grossly overpriced fast food inside the park. Then there's the ticket queue, and so it went on all day. Most rides had at least a 40 minute wait or longer   the queues are well hidden round corners so that you live in hope that the end is in sight, which it never is. Even the fast track queues were very long. No matter how good the ride, it's hard to justify such a lot of waiting. The sad thing is that most of the rides were pretty lame   maybe ok for very young kids if they could stand the waiting. A couple of good rides lasting 2 3 mins max, the rest were disappointing.

Now on to the negativities:1. The complexities of the overall package: vouchers, easypasses, restaurant bookings etc etc etc. All of these things made our overall experience very frustrating and confusing. There were a number of things that happened to us in relation to this but two examples as follows:   we went to the park one morning for breakfast as the breakfast in our hotel was revolting. We were not allowed in to our restaurant of choice because the hotel staff had not given us the correct vouchers to get in so we had to go to the coffee shop to buy a cake and coffee. The cashier at the park advised I could pay with my easy pass then tried to use it and promptly told me I couldn't use it, so I tried to pay with credit card as there was a sign at the cash register that said  Disneyland welcomes MC , was then told CC would not be accepted. We then had to search high and low for a cash machine to change cash and pay with cash. When we checked out of the hotel, we noticed that our bill had been charged so essentially, they charged us twice!    second example of this is in relation to booking restaurants. The written documentation I received before we left home, stated that we should book our restaurants but when I called the booking line, the staff were unable to access the details of my package to advise which restaurants were available to me. We booked restaurants but then we weren't able to access some of them because they were not part of our package....so what's the point of booking them then??? It's all a waste of time and it's very frustrating.The other thing I would say is that the queues are a real problem. The fast pass situation is not a real solution as you can see from the  fast pass  queues. On hot days (when we were there it was over 30 degs cel), there's seating but it's all in the sun so if you want to sit and wait for your family to queue for a ride, there's no where to sit. We often had to sit on the floor.It's often very difficult to see where the entry points are for the rides and there's very limited signage for toilets. The staff do not speak great English so it would really help if these things could stand out more, to save the frustration of trying to find them on a map. I would also say that it would be helpful if we could get more of an idea of what some of the rides that are inside the big warehouses are like. There's very little description of them so the kids are wary to go on.OK, I've complained enough. I know it seems like a whinge but if you don't provide this feedback, I suppose they won't know what needs to be done to improve things.

Still more people and I waited 20 minutes to purchase two drinks at a vendor. Sorry to say, I just do not get it. There were no Disney character's to see or meet, limited spots for lunch, ques everywhere and really nothing to see.My three boys agree with me. It was a waste of money.

1546,135354335,2,2012-7,Canada,"I came here with my girlfriend, she has been here before and loves it. I am not hating on this place, it is a cool place but for a couple or someone without kids I think it only has so much appeal. All the kids there seemed to love it, they all had huge smiles and it was awesome to see so many children having a great time. I just don't think there is much there for a purely adult demographic which sucks because adults pay the entry fees. Saying that, it is Disney Land and the place is pretty spectacular. The grounds are clean, well manicured and looked after, there are plenty of staff there to assist guests. The entrance fees are very expensive, 74 euros per adult for a 2 park pass for one day is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. I have been to many, many theme parks on 4 continents and this was the most expensive by far. The food and drink is also more than you would pay outside the park but it isn't ridiculously expensive to their credit. For most of the attractions you are looking at  30 minutes, saying that the lines did seem to move faster the majority of the time compared to the predicted wait. There are little electronic clocks at the front of the attractions that alert you on how long to expect. This is a good idea and allows you to time manage better. Most of the shows are similar to other parks like Universal Studios, Dreamworld and Warner Brothers movie world to name a few but they are still entertaining. The movie magic illusion show was amazing, probably the thing I enjoyed most in both parks. The movie studio park closes officially at 7 yet at 5:30 we couldn't buy food or drink from several of the vendors there. Be warned also that most the shows, rides and parades etc finish earlier at both parks well before closing ie at least an hour, be sure to check the program. I didn't get to go on a few of the rides but the simulator, pirates of the Caribbean and a few others that I thought would be exhilarating failed to hit the spot. I think the rides cater more to the kids which I understand but there are many rides coded blue which means family friendly for kids and only a few coded orange for exhilarating rides. The ones coded orange took it to a comfortable level but just when you are getting the adrenalin pumping seems to be where they peak. If you are a thrill seeker or there with some friends and want to experience some rides that are going to knock your socks off, I would recommend you look elsewhere.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

I pre purchased tickets before leaving and printed the voucher expecting not to have to que. Upon arrival around 1120 we headed straight to the que to exchange the printed voucher for an actual park ticket which took around 20 minutes. Whilst heading into the ticket que and the main entrance, parents, supposed adults ran and shoved to get in front of us.Once we entered we immediately needed a parents room facility which we failed to find so in lieu we used a slightly dirty disabled toilet and our pram to change our son in. Nappy changed we started our walk around fighting the masses and people who just didn't seem to want to walk around a pram, so we found ourselves constantly weaving through the crowd. Our son being only 10 months we knew we would be restricted on applicable rides and after stopping and asking a young staff member he confirmed this. Against his comment we lined up for the dumbo ride, and after an hour or so of obnoxious, pushy, smoking adults the kids in the lines were getting cranky. We got on our ride that lasted all of a couple minutes to do it all again for the tea cup ride.Lunch time came around and again a 30 plus minute line up and lack of available seating to sit at. We walked around for another hour or so quite frustrated with the whole thing and trying to get a slushy but the operators till was down. We walked around waiting for him and after about 45 minutes and using another park goers phone we lined up again to get a slushy. We finally left and were glad to be back on the train to Paris.

We had been to many theme parks and were expecting at least the same value, quality and experience. Given the price of entry to the Park, we thought that this alone reflected the quality. Unfortunately, we got none of those. First impressions are that the line to get in moved too slow. It took us almost an hour just to get in the park???!! Our first stop   bathroom. Oh Boy ... the smell was atrocious. I doubt that the plumbing was adequate to keep up with the number of tourists that visit the park. It was so disgusting that I reported it to staff   thinking that a sewerage pipe had broken. Even the staff member told me that nothing was broken, just a lot of people visit the bathroom???? Most of the rides in the park required at least a 95 minute wait and as you can imagine, young children can't wait in line that long. We went in the middle of the week; no school holidays and apparently on a  better day  than normal. Long story short, we couldn't wait to get back to Paris city away from the dreadful smells and queues. On a positive note, the grounds themselves, were very well kept & nice and green and full of flowers. In the middle of Paris City, near La Place de la Concorde, there is a little amusement park open and our child and many children we knew had more joy at this little amusement park  free entry, just pay for rides  than they did at Disneyland.

Waiting times for the Roller Coasters are around 70 to 90 Minutes, and during my visit, two of them had stopped functioning for some time, a big disappointment. If you have kids, even worse, as all kids' rides have even longer waiting times, so prepare to buy a 2 or 3 day ticket, or just let the kids enjoy as you stare at them and yourself do nothing.

To start with the place is extortionate, all the souvenir shops sell all the same items and its all tat. The queues to get in if you do not have tickets already are long, very long. Once in you are subjected to loud music everywhere, very few seats and the toilets are disgraceful. The toilets are very few and far between and during our visit we did not see them get cleaned once, anywhere. The rides take a very, very long time to get on, if the sign says 40 minutes you might as well add another 20 on for good measure!!! We went on most of the bigger rides and found the only way to save time and stress was to use the fast pass facility, which was good but the more popular rides soon ran out and then the queues were upwards of an hour minimum. Thunder Mountain during our six day visit was out of action for  technical reasons  at least twice to our knowledge. We found at this time that the staff, who were normally very helpful, retreated and became non existent. The few times that we did queue, the lines went on forever, very discreet and hidden at the entrance to the ride to get you in and then the long wait begins. The few roller coasters that are there are very much the same and are very much a let down after the long wait, two minutes or less is pretty rubbish. Overpriced drinks and food, so if you can bring your own in, the shop in the train station is great compared to the park. If you like eating cardboard you will be right at home. The Mickey parade that happens, well, if you have seen it or don't want to see it again is a nightmare, people queue and block the street ages in advance and when it starts you are stuck or have a very long walk around.The Walt Disney Studio which is a lot newer, has been designed to shepherd you right past the souvenir shops, there is no other way to get into the main area. The rides in this park are also very busy. This park only had a handful of food outlets and the restaurant we used, Restaurant des Stars, was not good. Buffet style, with the same food all day every day, barely edible, luke warm and quite often with long queues.The meal vouchers which we had in advance were of some use, but, only a few restaurants give you the full value of the voucher, meaning you don't get what you have paid for. All the restaurants we used , Silver Spur Steakhouse (disgusting undercooked and like old shoe leather), Walts, and Plaza Gardens were all terrible. However, Buzz Lightyears Pizza Planet was VILE!!! Paper plates and plastic cutlery!!! If you really want substandard food you will be right at home. The food in here was vile and had no taste the floor dirty and the tables needed to cleaned properly. We certainly did not expect this substandard quality from Disney.The majority of younger children looked distressed and bored. The parents equally so. By the time my four year old son got to meet Mickey he was bored and frustated. A lot of people seem to leave their manners at the gates and charge with no regard for anyone in their way. The strollers that are available are used by some people like battering rams. We will never go back here,the cost did not live up to the return.

Our party comprised 2 adults and 2 children (6 and 3), and lasted 2 nights, 3 days. It started positively enough with good value for money parking at the local NCP car park and easy access to the train station. Passport control was efficient and embarkation stress free. We then arrived at DLP. Our bags were left at the station and were available for collection at the hotel, so far, so good. Upon arrival at the Station, we were herded into the main shopping and restaurant area. We wandered up and down the main street looking for signs for the main parks,or someone to ask. The one employee we did find, claimed not to know where the main park was...helpful. To be fair, it wasn't that difficult to find, and entry into the main attractions was hassle free (but only with Pre booked tickets, which fortunately we had). Once inside, the enormity of our mistake in coming here began to sink   it was packed,and I mean really,really packed. Many people may be afraid to tell themselves, and their friends, that they did not enjoy their visit because of its cost, and because of the build up to something which for many may be a once in a lifetime experience. But, I can tell you, our immediate observation was that the park was filled with stressed and angry looking parents, and children in melt down: and the ratio of positive to negative comments on this and other sites is not reflective of the sense which we got of the experience people were having. So, we wandered up the main street of the main park, and there were more shops selling the same merchandise available in the shops in the area into which we disembarked   always good to have a second chance in life. Then, some restaurants, then, some more shops. At last we arrived at the entrance of the big castle, and to be fair, it was pretty impressive (especially if you are 3 and 6). A good photo opportunity taken. We moved into the area of the main attractions. I'll spare you a blow by blow account of each ride but suffice it to say, the ride to queue ratio was about 30 minutes queue to 1 minute ride. Most rides lasted for about two minutes, and we did not not queue for anything for less than 55 minutes. Do not trust the queue ready reckoners   they bear no resemblance to reality, and it was not often that this was a point in one's favour. At the merest hint of humidity, most of the rides shut down creating tremendous pressure on those which remained open, and the few play areas were particularly sensitive to the weather. I appreciate the good h&s reasons why this was necessary. The queues, and their length, were a particular problem for those attractions such as meeting the princesses where by the time one actually got to meet the princess (two on shift at any one time, and you're told who you'll see) the children were in a state of total boredom, frequently in tears, and not prepared to talk to anyone   and to be clear, this was not just (one of) my children but around 75% of the queue population   some of these will have been your friends who will have told some of you what a fantastic experience the whole thing was. The child in front of us refused to meet the princess because he was so bored, and one of ours was totally dis interested by the time the big moment came. To be fair to the character, she was very good, and one of my children loved the fleeting moment. But: in, hello, photo, out. Only time will tell if the 75 minutes queue was worth the wait , I hope my daughter remembers the event with fondness. With the exception of a fleeting, long distance glimpse of the disney princesses during one of the parades (which were fun, it has to be said) that was the sum total of access to those characters   access to them was very, very tightly protected. Indeed,the following day, we saw them make a sprint from the location of the meet and greet, to wherever was their destination   not quite ignoring the crowds but clearly uncomfortable about being seen in the open. Once or twice a day, one of the cartoon characters would make an appearance for 5 or 10 minutes, and so starved was the population of access to their favourite characters whom they had travelled to see and meet, that they were very quickly swamped by the crowd,including by adults with no thought for others. It is hard to explain,and the anger is subsiding as the memory fades, but the way the queues were engineered in itself gave rise to stress and tension. Somehow, the designers had managed to insinuate that the end of the queue was nigh, and just as we thought we were near the queue's end, we would perhaps take a corner which revealed several hundreds of previously unseen queuers, or into another room where the real queuing was about to begin. You will know what I mean if, when balancing the positive and negative reviews, you decide that only by itching yourself the Disney scratch will you be able sleep easily again at night! Toilets. Some reviewers have said that the toilets were disgusting. We did not find this to be the case but what I would say is that they were not in abundance, and neither were they very well signposted (nor was anything, for that matter). For many, this will not be a problem but for those with children between, say, 2 and 4,there is sometimes an urgency associated with these matters which is best served with immediate, or near immediate, access to such a facility! Food. The following sentence is one which I thought I would never write, nor even give consideration to writing. By far and away ......(forgive me, my fingers are struggling to input the necessary letters) Macdonalds was the best value for money (with a caveat) but more importantly by the point at which we took the decision (after a family crisis conference) wholesome and tasty meal we ate. For supper on the first day, we visited a pizza pasta place where we queued to order and pay and then queued to collect the food. I'm not sure how the chef managed to create this thing which was called a pizza but it seemed, somehow, watered down   it was devoid of taste, of constituency, of heat, of any sense of enjoyment or even simply physical fulfilment (and I know that may sound particularly ungrateful and immaterial in comparison to the plight of some, as may the rest of this review, but I would ask that it be read in context). I don't believe that water actually escaped from it when it was punctured with my knife and fork, though it may have been, but I would not have been surprised had it been. I've always thought it to be pretty impossible to get pizzas or beef burgers that wrong and so the next day (and I do feel guily about this) we had lunch at a burger bar. Again, we queued for about 30 minutes (at peak time,to be fair) and having been served then discovered that the ability of the restaurant to serve customers far exceeded its ability to seat them. We sat and ate our tepid filler on the floor outside the outlet. The food in the 'meet the Disney characters' place was the probably the worst and must have derived from the universal beast   fish indistinguishable from chicken, chicken from beef. Indistinguishable that is except in the hostility with which it was served, and the (cold) temperature at which it was served. All that said, the   30 odd per head did provide the best 30 minutes the children had across the 3 days with a good selection of cartoon characters enthusiastically visiting each table and so in that respect did provide some sort of value. Shows. The shows were good, and if I had my time again with the experience of the past 3 days, I would make more use of these opportunities. Though the queues were often excruciating one at least got 10 15 minutes of 'payback' (most shows advertised duration of 20 minutes) but at least 5 minutes of that time was spent telling the audience not to take pictures, film or do anything which may in any way infringe copyright (didn't seem so worried about telling it where fire doors etc were located). What, you may ask, did I expect? Well, I didn't expect my wife to cry in pure frustration at the overwhelmingly disappointing experience (she is a wonderfully pragmatic person and always seeks out the sitive in any given situation person) and I didn't expect the 3 year old constantly to ask to go home. I recognise that I am lucky to have been able to have experienced this, and some may say 'I would love the opportunity to queue for 90 minutes with my chidlren'. If you are lucky enough to be able to save hard to afford a holiday this year, then my strongest advice would be not to go to DLP. Long and rambling, for which apologies, but I hope this helps.

For other attractions (Peter Penn, Pinoccio, Disney train) we waited over 40 minutes and then were told that due to technnical problems we should come back later. When we came back later, these attractions were closed ! You can imagine the disappointment of the kids (and us) waiting for nothing. Toilets were so dirty, you could not use them. We did not see anyone cleaning them during the day. Cold water and ice cream are sold only at few stands, so you had to wait 15 minutes in cues for water each time (it was a very hot day). But the most terrible experience was lunch. Most of the restaruants were closed, leaving one fast food place open to serve thousands of visitors. We stood up in line for lunch 2 hours !!! I repeat, 2 hours !, in a crowded stinky stuffy room with over 500 people, attended by 8 slow, inefficient and indifferent staff. Then we had to eat sitting on the floor outside, as no available chairs and tables. EUR 150 just for nuggets fries cokes and starving annoyed kids. What a day.

1565,133172722,2,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We had two days in the park studio using free vouchers from Sky. Unfortunately the lows probably outweigh the highs in this case. We went with 3 adults and 2 small children (1 & 3) so this review is mainly for the small child friendly areas of the park.Getting there wasn't too bad but we arrived at about 10am on the first day, BIG MISTAKE. Once you get close to the park there is a security check which took about 45 mins to get through, in the rain and constant barging and pushing in as no line organisation was in place. After getting in we had another queue to get tickets and then another queue to get in through the gates so it was 11.15am by the time we got in. We got our bearings and found our pre booked lunch restaurant by which point it was 11.45 and lunch was at 12, so we basically got to the park, got in and had to go for lunch.Lunch on the first day was with the princesses and was very up market. Veggie options were very limited (they offered salmon as a veggie option!) which was disappointing so our girls ended up with plain pasta with butter on it, but the princesses did come round and talk to all the kids, have photos taken and sign autographs which was really good. It was VERY expensive though (  50 per adult and about   20 25 for a child) so you needed to have something to justify that. (you can meet the princesses elsewhere in the park but you have a long queue and less time with them). After lunch we hit the rides which all had long queues (30 mins plus for even simple rides) but we did several of the smaller ones like Snow White, Pinocchio and used a fastpass on Peter Pan. The rides are very dark and a bit scary for young kids and tended to be over very quickly. Best ride of the park was  Its a small world  which was very cheesy but quick to get on and very impressive to young eyes. (tip: the right hand lane is fastest) We also did Autotopia which wasn't worth the wait tbh. We left early that day to see the Wild West show (see review) in the village but came back educated and much earlier the next day.Getting there at 8.40 the following day we were up and through the security and ticket queues in time for the gates to open at 9.30. The park is not fully open but you can get in and wait to get into the ride areas at 10am. We went straight to Buzz Lightyear (getting a fastpass for Space Mountain on the way) and it was great to get in with very little queuing ~10 mins. We had time for Orbitron before Space Mountain which was dark, rough and made me feel sick. Still quite early we went across to frontier land but the mine train had a huge queue so we tried the haunted house which was quite good. Lunch was looming and we had reserved a table at Mickeys Cafe for lunch with the characters which was excellent. All characters came round met the kids and had photos and the food was good and much cheaper (though not cheap) than the princesses lunch.After lunch we tried the studios (reviewed seperately) but gave up and came back to the park mid afternoon heading back up to have candy floss, do pirates of the caribbean (good ride, awful queue if you are claustrophobic ) and finally the teacups. It was then time for the parade so we headed back down grabbing dinner from the high street deli. The parade was excellent, every bit as good as the florida equivalent and a real highlight for young kids. The route gets roped off early so make sure you find a good spot about 6.30pm (you can sit on the raised grass around the main square for a good view).Useful tips: Parking is 15 euros but the RER station is right by the entrance and you can park at Val de L'europe shopping centre 1 stop up for free (good tip for heading to paris too!)Get there early! If you are not in the car park by 8.30 9am you probably won't be through security and tickets when the rides open to non hotel guests.Get a fastpass early for must do rides as it very quickly becomes hours to wait to use one and you can only have one at a time. Not all rides have a fastpass!Food and drink is expensive and there are queues everywhere. We saw many people with picnics (despite being told you can't) so I would consider bringing some bits in with you.If you have several days and have seen the parade I would consider doing big rides etc during the parade and lunch as I am convinced it would be quieter given the number of people watching the parade.As a previous reviewer said, if you aren't staying at the park to get access early don't plan on doing everything as the queues are horrific.Summary: Okay but not great and the queues made it barely tolerable. The fact that I had free tickets meant I didn't feel cheated not being able to go on half the rides despite having 2 full days there.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

1567,133020782,2,2012-6,Ireland,"Overall... disappointed.We spent a day in the park with three children (6 9 and 11) and found it disappointing, despite having been there ourselves as adults perhaps 15 years ago and enjoying it at the time.I think its ideal for younger children who are not interested in the main rides   our six year old gave it  a gazillion out of a hundred  which says it all... and she was happy to go on the smaller rides where the queues were less absurd. The queues were in intense hot sunshine in some cases with young inadequate cover which is not acceptable for people with children.1) the queues for the main rides on a weekday were RIDICULOUS and systematically   heavily understated at the start points   it took us over an hour to get onto the main rides and in some cases it was listed at 30 mins. I don't mind queueing but I don't like being taken for a ride!2) the  entertainment  in the queues was non existent. Some kids has their Nintendos with them. There were no Disney figures walking about, which I seem to recall from our trip and no details of when the shows or parades included in the main guide. 3) FAST PASS is a joke unless you are very dedicated to using it and you can only use one at a time. You might be asked to come back to a ride three hours later, at which point you might be in the other park! It does cut your queuing time substantially but unless you have DAYS to spend there, you will simply not have enough time to visit even all of the main attractions...4) Buying your rail ticket and park ticket as a bundle is NOT the cheapest option in every case. Check with the information desk in Gare de Lyon. We did and it was substantially cheaper...5) There was an appalling stench of urine and worse in the queuing space for one of the children's rides   I think it was Dumbo. This was not a child having an accident, this was an infrastructural problem which the park management need to address as a serious health risk. Overall I got the impression   whether this is right or not   that they simply admitted too many people and choked the entertainment out of the place. When we asked if they would go back, the 6 yo gave it a resounding yes, the 9 and 11 yos said a resounding NO and compared it very unfavourably with Gardaland and other theme parks, which they enjoyed in previous years. Having been to Florida I don't recall similar problems there and would suggest that Eurodisney, however its branded, is on the decline. I think the intervening years   with the proliferation of state of the art video games and consoles   has rendered these parks suitable for young children ONLY and go there on the quieter days only.FWIW",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Over the years I've taken my kids to Disney Word and Disney Land in the US, so I thought it was about time I tried Disneyland Paris.The place is horrible. Its the saddest place on earth. The staff are miserable and rude, there is none of the cheer and happiness that you usually find at disney parks, instead you get sullen french workers who never smile and make no effort to interact with the children. A number of times i heard them being rude to guests in french (thinking that no one could understand them).The entrances is a mess, with workers standing around blocking entrance gates and demanding you hand them your tickets so that they can insert them in the slot. Iin addition anyone entering with a wheelchair or pushchair has to wait for several minutes for someone to open the access gate and then manually turn the gate. Ridiculous!At the entrance there are also bag searches, but this is completely pointless as they dont search the bag properly. Its all for show.The exception to this is the costume characters (mickey etc), who pose for photos, but they only appear two or three times during the day and for about 10 mins, so its chaos as people push to get their photo. The park is 20 years old now, and its really showing its age, Nearly all the rides kept shutting down mid ride (such as the buzz light year ride), and in the event of rain most of discovery world shuts.The highlight of the day is supposed to be the parade, and be warned as it will be crowed. The parade was acceptable, but NOTHING compared to the ones in the US.I really cannot stress this enough, DO NOT GO HERE, save up and go to the US parks instead for a true Disney experience.

Getting off the Eurostar there was no signage telling you which direction the hotels were and no cast members in the station to give you directions. Express luggage service there but we were never offered the service even being hotel guests. Pouring rain we finally found out we needed to walk through The Disney Village or find a bus which we didn't know where.

Cards didn't work, back to the front desk, with attitude, staff returned with new cards, to our mediocre room. Breakfast room crowded and very noisey.

Went to eat dinner at 7pm the park was open till 11pm and the 4 restaurants we tried were all closed.

I am a massive Disney fan and I know the Disney company prides itself on perfection, the best customer service and a magical experience across all of it's parks, well I am sorry to say that Disneyland Paris didn't really have any of these. Basically it doesn't come anywhere close to the Orlando resort and I found that Disneyland Paris definitely does NOT have the Disney magic or atmosphere that it should have. Yeah we had fun, went on most of the rides (admittedly a few are better than Orlando versions), the queues were not as big as Orlando. To cut a long story short:GOOD:  The Disney Dreams show at the castle and the fireworks were out of this world, really amazing! (this was about the only hint of Disney magic that I felt in 2 full days at the parks)  Space Mountain Mission 2 was faster and longer than the Orlando version, as was Thunder Mountain, I guess this is because they are newer and more modern  Indiana Jones rides was good to experience as not been on it before  The Tarzan show was good for watching all of the acrobats but didn't understand the story at all as it was in French (not complaining about the language though as I'm all for when in Rome.... lol)  I know this is in Disney Village but I would recommend the Buffalo Bills Wild West Dinner show as this was a great night, I really really enjoyed this!BAD:  The customer service and attitude from the majority of the Disney staff was absolutely terrible, definitely not the usual happy, smiley, cheerful, helpful Disney staff that I am used to. All very miserable and try to avoid helping you most of the time!  The ride queue times were no where near accurate. Star Tours stated 15 mins so we decided to go on due to the short queue time... 55 mins later we actually got on the ride!

The park is full of very pushy visitors who were just obnoxious, rude and didn't know the meaning of the word queue.

One particular toilet block looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week! Very smelly... yuck!I could go on and on but I won't bore you anymore lol.

I have been back more than 25 times overs the years, so of course, on my first trip to Paris, I had to see Disneyland Paris. My first clue should have been the 20% discount coupon that I was able to find on a one day 2 park ticket. In my experience, you NEVER find such a coupon for Disneyworld. Sure, they discount the tickets, but never more than a couple of bucks.OK, no problem redeeming the coupon. We went right over to their Disney Studios park because it closed at 6 pm and Disneyland didnt close until 11 pm.I guess this one is meant to be like the MGM Hollywoord studios. At first glance, the park looked like Disney. Nice buildings, flowers, statues. Right past the Studio 1 building, we noticed Minnie Mouse and a line of kids so we went over to take a picture. I've seen other reviews about crowds, people not waiting their turn, and pushy parents. But, how about a pushy Minnie? Yes, Minnie pushed a lady out of the way to take a photo with another child. Now in Minnie's defense, the lady appeared to not wait her turn, but when have you ever seen a character pushing someone? Next, we began to look for shows and rides. Armageddon broken, Aerosmith broken, Lilo and Stitch and Disney Playhouse show in French every 10 20 minutes. In English, every 2 3 hours. Fast Pass machines not in use even though lines warranted it. So, in 4 hours, we got on one ride and just decided to sit in a good spot and wait for the parade. Another disappointment. I know there's a recession, but the parade was over in like 5 minutes. Crazy. I've never seen anything like it.Oh, if you use the bathrooms, bring some toilet paper and a mask because it smells like a NYC subway station in there. Actually, the subway probably smells better.Off to the Disneyland park. Much of the same. No characters around, rides broken including Space Mountain, no fast passes, line times not accurate. If it says 30 minutes, expect 45, etc. Bathrooms just plain nasty. At Disney, this is unheard of. After much frustration and a long day, we just said heck, let's get some ice cream or French fries. We searched for food for about an hour because at 8 pm, all eating establishments off of Main Street were closed or closing despite the park not closing untill 11pm. Notably, all Disney paraphernalia stores and carts were open. We finally made our way to Main Street and found ice creams and waited about an hour and 45 mins for the Disney Dreams show.I feel sorry for Parisiens if they think this is the Disney experience.

1585,131576490,1,missing,United Kingdom,"We visited during half term with a teenager and a 4 year old. We absolutely fell in love with Disney world Florida when we visited years ago and have wanted to go back ever since but thought we'd try the cheaper closer option. We didn't expect it to be on par with Florida but perhaps a scaled down version of the Disney magic...we were very mistaken!The park itself is stunning to look at and that Disney magic hits you the minute you walk in...but it's pretty much all down hill from there. If it were not for this, the parade and show, I would not have recognised it as the Disney brand at all. The first dissapointment is the lack of characters, they are rarely seen outside of the parades and it is a fight (quite literally) to get an autograph for the 10 minutes or so they appear, leaving lots of dissapointment and crying children when they dash back off. Of course this wouldnt be so bad if you could just stroll along to the next character, but they are no where to be seen unless you are willing to queue up for 2 hours to see a princess (just one and you don't know which One until you get to the end of queue in princess castle) or you're a fan of Duffy bear(yes who the hell I that?). The park is overcrowded, queues are long and queue jumping prolific with staff not intervening or interested. The toilets are dirty and smelly and in general it's is appallingly run with zero customer service focus. Part of the magic of Disney is the fun atmosphere, this is dead here. In Florida it felt like everything was organised with the absolute aim of delivering a excellent and magical experience with efficient ways of distributing the large crowds and minimising queuing etc. Here, it is the opposite, they just can't be bothered and the experience is one of frustration, dissapointment and relief to get out of here.We had high hopes for this place and were hoping to buy annual passes and come regularly but we will never return to this park, I'd rather pay the extra and tolerate the long flight for the real thing because it really is worlds apart. It's such a shame because most of what is lacking could be fixed with a refocus on delivering an excellent 'disney' experience to the customer, the foundations are laid but have been neglected. I suggest the management go over to Florida and see what Disney really does and stands for, because this is a poor and disgraceful imitation. My advice is save up for Florida if you can, we never had a single complaint in two weeks, it was out of this world.

They have a fast pass option but there was no one to tell us how to get the fast pass.When we found one that explained that we were already eligible for one,the people near the characters said they were done with fast pass for the day and wouldn't give no more.A little heads up at the ticketing counter would have taken care of this.We wanted to get on the train ride,the ushers there said that the train was not working & when we asked could they tell us when it would be functional they said they had no clue.Two hours later when we went back and asked them,they said the train rides for the day was done & it was just 4:45p:m and the train rides were supposed to end at 6p:m.They were endless queues everywhere.They totally suck at crowd management. Didn't think that Disney is so dysfunctional.All in all a terrible experience.Wasn't magical at all for my little boy who was crying when they said there were no train rides.Who cried again at not being able to meet the characters he really wanted to meet.Just wasted a lot of money and I will think a hundred times before I set foot on another Disney property.Seems like Disney is super confident that no matter what people will still go.But I am making sure that I will keep my family & friends away from this property.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The Paris park does no credit whatsoever to the US version. We were perhaps naieve to think that the magical branding of disney would be international, the french version is very much intended for the french to the exclusion of other nations. It's hard to explain to small children who know the words to their favourite disney films that it may be the same tune but with different words (french!) In short the whole park attitude had the typical shoulder shrug of the french when parades were re routed with no announcements and children invited to join other parades and then shooed away when they had enough kids to look the part   again hard to explain to small kids. I read other review sites before visiting and also have to agree with other visitors about the lack of characters around the park to see or meet for photos. The only one we did see walking around was the scary looking queen from alice in wonderland who had a full head mask, not great for small kids!

We were mitigating our expectations, which in case of people who grew up behind the Iron Curtain dreaming about places like this is not that easy, even many years later and with a happy kid of our own, now living in much better world. But despite being careful about that, we left with the sense of disappointment.True, the Park is impressive, terrain is appointed beautifully, some of the attractions are great, other average. True, Disney has a lot of capital from its movies and characters. But it is an opportunity lost. And it's not about dirty and smelly toilets, or lousy Ipad app or web page. It's about many little things that overshadow whatever  Disney experience  is was supposed to be. Queues were terrible. We did not manage to find an attraction with waiting time less than 30 minutes, for a ride of 3. We did eventually see Mickey at the parade at 7 pm   and none of the characters throughout the day. Nor have we seen experienced any sort of help advice interest courtesy from the pretty much absent staff. We were informed, that number of restaurants close at 5 pm   just when we planned to grab something to eat, which left us running around to find anything open. And once we found it, the queue to the toilet for kids was about 15 minutes waiting time. And that's only after you wait another 15 minutes for the table. And then because of the toilet queue you can't watch the parade because, as everywhere, there's just too many people to find a good spot   and the number of people is eventually the biggest issue throughout the visit. You just try to navigate through crowd while trying not to lose your kid instead of focusing on what is nice out there. And when you top it all up with the regular ticket prices   it then becomes quite ridiculous. We left in the evening, with the impression we were welcome to spend money big time, and not at all bother to ever come back. Disappointed by Disney. Disappointed by the American type service quality we expected in this place, we love, we miss and we found none of. Disappointed by way management doesn't seem to even try to make things right.

I'm glad I did this for myself, but I would never visit this park again unless there were some serious changes.The good:  Dinner at Cafe Mickey was the highlight. The food was edible    not great but not bad    and by itself would be considered overpriced. However, you're not paying for the food, you're paying for the show. And its not really a show, its 5 separate Disney characters coming out and visiting every single table, taking their time to pose for pictures, play with the guests, etc. Its really well done, and afterwards a manager visits each table to ensure that each character visited.   The attractions were mostly fun, and despite all the hassles listed below, my kids still had a great time.The Bad  In a nutshell: the park is poorly managed, from rides, parking, concessions, and sanitation. There are fewer rides and activities than the parks in the U.S., instead there are lots of places to buy overpriced food and souvenirs. The park is also smaller than in the U.S., or at least feels that way.  Rides weren't managed well, in terms of getting people on and off (which took longer than many of the rides). The train that runs around the park ran super slow because they only ran half the trains.   Pirates of the Caribbean is shorter than the one in the U.S., and its so dark its hard to see.   Not enough bathrooms and they were disgusting. Given the   of sanitation codes in the EU, I'm surprised they haven't been shut down yet. Long waits, and we went on a rainy weekday...can't imagine this during the peak season.  Food was a total rip off, as everyone says.  Unlike the U.S. parks, smoking is allowed everywhere (in the U.S., its only in a few designated areas). Parents smoking in tight lines, blowing smoke and ashes to everyone around them...it was really, really bad.If you've never been to a Disney park and can't get to the U.S., this might be worth it.

Once in December (a very busy time), once in January, and once at the end of February. The day we went in December was extremely busy (granted it was close to Christmas), and lines were extremely long. Even Buzz Lightyear was over an hour wait, and we utilized Fast pass on that one. Utilizing fast passes though, in total, we only rode about 5 rides for the whole day. Lines were just crazy long. My main complaint is that the park does not have designated smoking areas for the smokers. Do you know how many people smoke in Europe?!!! There are smokers everywhere, and they even smoke while waiting in the lines, even though there are non smoking signs clearly marked there. The visits in January and February were more tolerable (less people, less smokers), but again we were constantly walking into wafts of smoke, and again we had to deal with idiots smoking in line. I told one employee who told the young girls it was not allowed, only to have the young girls continue to smoke, and clearly flout the authority of the employee. It's ridiculous. I had to yell at them to get them to stop, and the whole scene is not ideal for kids (including me having to yell). In terms of public smoking, Disneyland Paris is 30 years behind the US. Just have designated smoking areas! Finally, as to the park itself, it pales in comparison to the Anaheim Disneyland and Disney world. It's not terrible, but smaller, though my son did like the Suspension Bridge. Thunder mountain was closed on 2 of our visits, but we finally got to ride it on our last visit. The second park, Disney Studios, is very small, and seemed like an afterthought. Even the tram ride left much to be desired, but lines here in Jan Feb were much shorter (approx 20 minutes), though my son wanted to leave that park quickly and go back to Disney.

Pros: pain free transfer from CDG airport on VEA Navette to the resort; staying at Disney's Hotel New York was close to the parks and provided plenty photo opportunities with Disney characters. Cons: hotel's well publicised ice skating rink was an additional cost despite staying there and anyway, was out of use for the full four days, despite freezing temperatures outside and Disney lakes being frozen over thus halting boat trips. Accommodation requires urgent updating. Food is unhealthy, tasteless and of a poor standard throughout. We chose not to opt for meal deals as part of out package, thinking this would provide the freedom and choice for better food. How wrong were we? Believe it or not, the best place for a fresh salad and water was McDonalds! Shame on you Disney. Also their coffee machines throughout the resort are awful. Best coffee was at the airport.

The room still had rubbish in it when we arrived & they didn't even provide tea or coffee in the rooms. You are allocated a time for breakfast & then still have to queue for 25min to be seated. On arrival we were railroaded into having breakfast at the Plaza Gardens one morning but didn't know where that was we then found out it's a good 20 minute walk into the park & I was using a walking stick for a knee injury. The park itself is just a huge shopping centre. The food is overpriced and poor   even the coffee at 5 euros was undrinkable  many people we met complained that it was cold and that there was no choice. A lot of the park was a building site and the queues over an hour   I dread to think what it is like in peak season when the weather is better. My 7year old & I queued for over an hour to get to meet a princess and they turned around and said she was leaving. A number of very angry parents complained and after another 15 minutes she came back but apparently this is common practice. There is no care for how this affects children all they want is for you to spend money on expensive souvinirs and overpriced food. Of course once you have paid there is nowhere to go with it and you don't have any alternative choices as it is such a closed shop. Not worth the money at all.

I'd booked in advance for the 'enchanted christmas' season. My little girl just wanted to stay in the hotel room and do colouring so that just sums up how poor an experience it was.Flying there was time consuming, the airport at paris was not good, we set off from our home in north west england at 5:30am and arrived at the hotel (seqoia lodge) after 3pm.Sadly we don't speak french so we was not aware of any information about what was at the hotel etc. We ended up going to bed at 8pm that night because there was nothing to do and nowhere to buy any drinks or food! The TV did not work, and the room key was faulty (as many other room key's were too i discovered). Our room was nice enough and had a nice view of the lake, but it was a very long distance from the reception, so this was awful when we couldn't get into the room and had to keep going to reception. I'd advise not to use the mini bar in the room as there are incredible charges for this.Disney village   just shops (all selling the same thing), and eating places (all expensive with big waiting times)Disney park   what an absolute let down!!! we did not see any characters about the park, I paid   75 for my little girl to have dinner with the princesses, the food was awdul and blink and you'll miss what princesses came in! The castle was absolutely beautiful though and this was an absolute credit to disney   this is the only thing my little girl an I liked really. A lot of rides were closed. Santa's village was very poor   we waited in a queue for at least an hour with nothing to amuse the children, there was a post station were kids could write to santa but we found the girl giving them out very rude so didn't bother. You wouldn't have guessed it was christmas   apart from a big tree on main street and a little bit of pretend snow. Fantasyland was the only place with suitable rides for her age, but many were shut and the queues awful. One of the main attractions the pirate boat was shut too. Again all the shops sold exactly the same things in each   not what the guide book siad. The parades were poor   only 2 or 3 floats and we couldn't get anywhere near to really see.Studios park   awful. Getting in the entrance was a trauma in itself there was no organisation at all. Just same shops again, and massive queues for things, the queues were confusing too, you thought you were queueing for one thing then realised it was for something else. We didn't bother staying in. So sadly I was very upset at the experience. firends of mine have been 5 times at christmas although have not been for 5 years   the pictures they have are amazing   characters everywhere, pretend snow falling from roofs at main street when incredible parades where on   this was not the case when we went.

Gone is the wow factor, the oohs and aahs from the children. Most of the staff seem to hate their jobs, with smiles being hard to come by. One or two staff members go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful in true Disney style. The facilities are extreme. Food wise the restaurants are the most extortionately expensive I have ever come across. The cheapest for a family of two adults and two children is lunch for   100  Cinderella's Castle dinner would have cost a total of   415!!!!The toilets are an utter disgrace. In the two full days we spent at the park we did not see one single toilet attendant. It was typical to see excrement smeared across the toilet seat. If this is the standard French people are used to, they must be walking health hazards.Our visit on New Year's Eve included a 'spectacular' firework display at the stroke of midnight. It seemed a good idea to let the New Year in with a bang   what was provided was more of a fizzle than a bang. None of the signature cascading colourful display, just single shooting coloured rockets fizzling to nothing.Considering the onsite charges for food etc it is an utter disgrace that the park is not better maintained. Rides frequently broke down. We went on Buzz Lightyear 3 times and it broke down at least twice each time. Health and Safety appears to be non existent. At nightfall the park becomes a nightmare to traverse with very sparse lighting, cracked walkways galore, unmarked hazards such as very low fences, rockeries and slippery floors. Even the travelator to the car parks turned into a skating rink!!!It would be interesting to know how many visitors return home injured or with infections, food poisoning etc.A final tip: Disney Village has an excellent MacDonald's restaurant (normally one of my pet hates) they do not hike up their prices. We had 2 happy meals and 2 adults meals for less than   20   an absolute bargain by Disneyland Paris standards. Also they have an incredibly efficient touch screen ordering facility where you can order and pay by card. By the time you are finished paying your meal is ready for collection.

First of all we arrived the disney new york hotel, It was just a normal bog standard hotel with no disney touch on it. There were large queues to check in, and I would have thought that the disney characters would be entertaining the kids and welcoming them upon there arrival but they didn't. When we were done checking in we arrived in a poorly themed room that looked nothing like 'New York' at all or had that amazing disney theme to it. It wasn't amazing like made out to be on its website. The room wasn't clean, the bathroom had dirt on the floor when we arrived. Me and my brothers and sisters who are below the ages of 10 7 wanted to go on the rides, but much to our fears the place was packed. Disneyland Paris should have a sense to limit the number of people they have in the park at one time. But they kept on letting people in. So we thought just line up for something so we queued up for big thunder mountain, it was freezing cold and wet. And my aunt who plucked up the courage to get on the ride went on with us. The ride started of fine for a couple of seconds but then as our train got to the very top of the lift hill, the ride stopped the train was almost vertical it was very hard to get out as there was a big gap and it was trouble to get out of the car. We were very unhappy. My aunt now will not go on a roller coaster again because of what had happened she was very upset. The staff got us off quickly but going down the stairs was very tricky in the dark and wet conditions. We were furious we wasted 2 hours of queueing up. We surely thought they would offer compensation to us like lots of other theme parks do, but they didn't. That ride then broke down all the other times that we were there too. We went to cafe mickey. The service was very very poor. The food was horrible and the price was very hefty. It took us an hour just to get bread on our table. But they did a kind thing and gave us a free garlic bread for saying sorry after we complained. We then visited Planet Hollywood and Anntets diner in the disney village. They had service with a smile the food came very very quickly. Everyone was happy with there service. The staff at disneyland were rude and unhelpful. I asked where this and that was but they just nodded and walked away. And the staff on the rides didn't have any sense of humour or magic about them as advertised by disney. The place was very expensive too. All the rides we queued for broke down once and they just told people to leave without saying sorry or anything. A complete waste of time. The studio backlot tour was absolute rubbish too we queued for an hour just to see one 'alright' set. But the rides were fantastically themed and out of this world but a shame when they broke down and had a large queue. But I wouldn't be prepared to queue for a couple of hours. Yes they have fast passes but they don't really make a difference. I would rate this attraction very poorly. Visit UNIVERSAL STUDIOS instead of any disney parks. We visited universal studios in hollywood and it was amazing. The rides were empty and amazing, they have lots of characters walking around the park unlike disneyland. and they have amazing shows. I would highly recommend universal studios to anyone. It beats disneyland by a 10000 miles. The rides didn't break down once and we went for a week to universal the hotels are amazing there.

They come across rude and not bothered. Everyone smokes in the park so you leave smelling of smoke which cant be good for the children. They even light up in queues for rides so you cant even breath. Some of the rides are soo old and run down you can see the rust. Especially rides like Star Tours and Armaggedon should be closed down as they look like something out of the 90's. The Disney Village is just as bad Planet Hollywood is nothing compared to the London version. Rude waiters and old run down interior. Mcdonalds meals had more taste than Planet Hollywood. I was dissappointed at the overall experience. The queues were crazy and the security at the entrance was a joke. You could easily bypass the bag search by walking around the side and at some times they had no bag search at all. French people have no clue of how to queue and rather than stand in a line at rides and at the entrance they prefer to gather around and push through. The only positive was Val D'Europe the shopping centre near by. Had quite a few shops and resturants which we enjoyed. I would reccomend Disneyland Orlando if you want the real experience.

Although the children really enjoyed themselves we were exceedingly disappointed by the whole experience and how much it cost. The steam fair in the local park would have provided just as much fun for a tenth of the price. The whole place seems to be designed to pack in as many people as possible and treat them as badly as possible. The queues even for food are horrendous and when you get the food it is hardly worth eating. We couldn't find anywhere to sit inside so we were glad it wasn't raining. We tried a la carte in two different places as a result   what a disappointment too. I have just broken my leg so didn't plan to go on any rides. After the first day, when my husband and kids had only managed to get on three attractions, I decided I needed to go with them. People with disabilities go to the front of the queue   so with my magic pass we managed five attractions. But it took us two hours on the first day to obtain our pre booked park tickets, queue to get through security, queue for my wheelchair, queue to get in to the park and queue to get my disability pass. So some compensation. My advice to everyone is DON'T go   but obviously judging by the crowds many people do like it   and do back for me.

Not a big deal unless you're a Disney fan and know that this isn't usually the case with staff in other parks. Lastly, while you could get this anywhere, I had a man directly in front of us take nearly 200 flash photos during It's a Small World...in the US, this would be discouraged but here it's tolerated. Kinda ruined the 45 minutes we waited for the ride. Oh...and FYI for first timers to Europe, Sunday is family day so you're likely to have extremely long waits if you visit Disneyland Paris on a Sunday. 60 95 minutes wait per ride was our experience.

So I was surprised to find how bad of an experience we had in Disneyland Park and Studios.I won't complain about the cost of food and drinks, and they are expensive in all amusement parks, and it's just expensive in Europe period.The parks and rides themselves are mostly the same, although I found the Peter Pan ride to be very dark in the beginning. You could hardly see anything. After the dusk, many areas of the park are poorly lit! It was scary and few to no staff around.We were surprised to find that there are no nightly fireworks. The fireworks were at Disney Village (like Disney Downtown) on certain nights and to me had no Disney feel about it. It was more of a laser light show with rock or pop music (nothing to do with Disney) finishing off with some fireworks. The show lasted like 30 minutes, way too long. We were very bored and towards the end just wanted it to end. Actually, we left before it finished because we had dinner reservations at Cafe Mickey. I could not tell what the theme of the show was. Pink Floyd played at one point. I love Pink Floyd, but have no idea what it has to do with Disney.The parks are not that old, but the bathrooms look old and stink!My biggest complaint is all the smoking. You cannot escape it. People even smoke in line! I didn't notice in Disneyland Park, but I remember seeing a small sign just at the beginning of the line entrances in Studio in French that indicates no smoking. No one is around to enforce it, and if there is a rule to only smoke in designated areas of the park, no one follows it. I was just in shock by the number of people smoking, especially with all the kids around. Most of these people are smoking with their kids next to them, so of course they could care less about other kids. This really ruined the experience for us as my son and I are very sensitive to smoke. By the 2nd day, I had a sore throat. My son was coughing.Being Disney lovers, we want to go to all the Disney parks.

QueuesDon't think we queued for less than 90 minutes for any ride. Arrived 9.30am & left 11.30pm and we managed to go on 7 rides shows in 12 hours. Very difficult with children aged 6 & 7. It was painful.ShadeSome of the queues for the rides had no shade at all. We had to disappoint our child who was desperate to go on the new turtle  Crusher  ride.

When they did appear they were completely mobbed by everyone and kept moving walking on swiftly. This was dangerous as my yound child was grabbing on to them trying to hug them at the time as children will do! The characters paid more attention to unsuspecting adults 'patting' them on the head than to the children who were so desperately trying to get their attention.

1650,119851149,2,2011-10,United Kingdom,"We went for the first time to Disneyland Paris Sunday 16th October for 5 days. We stayed in a disney hotel which was ok although no tea or coffee facilities. The reason for this choice was that we could have the extra magic hours. What a waste of time. Disney only opens one park and then only certain rides so all that happened is that everyone from the Disney hotels turned up and we all waited in endless Q's. The cast members were in the main unable to keep the Q's moving quickly and it is not unusual to be standing in endless lines while the 'car' in half empty! I would say there is no magic about the place. It is a licence to print money. The food in the park is very expensive and horrible. Cold burgers, cold chips poor, poor quality. But the biggest rip off is the Disney Village where we went to eat. Basically for 2 adults and a 6 year old. The cheapest meal we had was 69 euros. And for comparison we would have expected to pay in Scotland around   20 for what we bought. Q's everywhere at night for the resturants. At best you could say it was a poor experience. In Mickeys cafe our bill came to about 90    . For that we got childrens meal 18    2 starters and 2 main meals with soft drinks. Planet Hollywood was expensive and although the waiter was nice to us during our meal as soon as we paid and left the tip he then just turned away without another word and was just plain rude. Cold coffee, milk shakes 8   , We as a family were so disappointed by the experience. As I have said without exception the food was just such poor quality and the service was not much better in all the places we went to eat in the village. Take plenty of money with you as you are going to need it. To compare we could have gone to an all inclusive 4 5* hotel for 7 days somewhere else in Europe and we would have still paid less that it cost to experience the  Disney Magic . So we wont ever go back. Although the child enjoyed Disney, I would say that the theme parks around the uk are much better when you take into account the overall cost of the whole trip.

1651,119786356,2,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Overall, this is not a true representation of a Disney theme park. It is a poor relation, they sell way too many tickets, so the parks are overcrowded, and there are not enough rides for people to go on, leaving huge queues. One morning as we entered there was a wait time of 95 minutes   first thing as the doors opened. This you don't see in Florida until well into the day and even then, there are far more rides and fast pass rides. Disneyland Paris has limited fast passes, half the rides break down on a daily basis, it is a total rip off for food, and what's more, the toilets stink and the characters giving autographs favour French speakers !Our main concern however, is that there is absolutely NO organisation of the characters giving autographs. Why can't there be an organised and civil line with people taking turns in an orderly manner ? The lack of organisation could be a joke except that our daughter's safety is no laughing matter. The characters are mobbed, our daughter was pushed and shoved by adults and we were alarmed that this happened time and time again. Furthermore, following a show on the stage, the characters came off the front of the stage, making the whole crowd surge forward. Our daughter was crushed between three adults who were more bothered about shoving their child on a photo, or to get to the packets of sweets the characters were handing out. It was totally unsafe, there was no barrier to stop the crowd crushing young children and this sort of action could cause an accident where a child could be injured. We have never been so anxious in a Disney park, and it spoilt our visit. Characters should not wander around allowing them to be swamped and encourage certain adults behaviour to become desperate and competitive to get to the characters. It is not acceptable health and safety in this day and age. The characters also wander from their initial spot   they are surrounded by a huge crowd of people with young children being pushed and shoved, then they make it worse by moving, always with the great mob following them   we lost our daughter on two occasions because the character moved. Again, this is not safe to do. No other Disney park has this irresponsible and disorganised way of access to characters. Every other Disney park has orderly managed lines with people taking turns. We would also like to point out that despite the rest of Europe banning cigarette smoking, the French still allow smoking outdoors, but what is not acceptable is that they allow adults within a Disney park to walk around, cigarette held at child height   ready for a child to be burnt by one. It is not acceptable.It is suffice to say that we would never return to Paris Disneyland   it cannot guarantee the safety of young children with its poor and unsafe practice.

1652,119783904,2,2011-10,United Kingdom,"I visited Euro Disney with my mother and grandmother during a trip to Paris, and we all disliked the park very much. It was chaos and frantic with a very weird, charged atmosphere. Everywhere kids were begging their parents to but stuff and it was all about wanting more and more. You couldn't go there for a day because there was so much to do. This isn't a good thing, we all felt like we HAD to do it all, and there wasbn't enough time which gave us a weirdly panicked feeling. I went there when I was four years old and apperently hated it then as well, we went again to see if I would appreciate it more seeing as I am tall enough to go on the rides.It was good at first. There was a show with singing and dancing and it was very impressive with the big looming fairy palace and the pretty streets. We went to adventure land, and lined up for twenty minutes for a ride. Then there was pure confusion, as you got a ticket with a time on and could only go on the ride during that time. We thought we'd just go on the ride then so it was a bit of an anti climax to be given a ticket, but we looked at the map and saw that these rides are 'fast pass' rides. By then we felt a bit depressed about the place but were determined to have a good day... yeah right!It was chaos. Little children looked plain confused about the place, and personally I didn't get the concept. It's meant to be about magic and imagination but I thought it was an outdated and old fashioned idea. A twenty minute line was considered short, and the longest we waited was forty five minutes for a ride though people were waiting for an hour. The food was overpriced, kids were high on sugar and screaming, and unlike the last time I visited there was no interaction with characters. I remember meeting Snow White but we didn't see any of that. It was like a museum, you had to admire the set from a distance but you weren't part of it, for example the ride round the park we were expected to 'ooh' and 'aah' at stuffed animals in the 'wild.' I think children benefit more from hands on activities, especially if they're too short to go on rides.So we were fed up and went to the other park in the same sight, the Disney Studio Park. We liked it better, it was less busy with less kids running about and had a calmer, less frantic feel to it. in the other park it felt like we had to do everything and eat everything and buy everything. We waited for forty five minutes for the Rock and Rollercoaster only to hear a tannoy saying it had broken down and we'd have to wait another hour. We couldn't be bothered so the only thing we went on in that park was a Toy Story themed ride that would have been at home in my town's annual fair. There was a 'tram' studio tour that was in fact a lorry, and we drove and looked at things from films like 'Dinotopia'. There was a part when a barrel went on fire and the lorry rocked about but I wasn't very impressed.So overall, it's all about squeezing more money from parents as kids want to experience everything in one go. You'd have to stay there to experience everything at the park, but in somewhere as culture rich as Paris, who'd want to stay in Disneyland? I wasn't impressed at all.

The lodge looks nice as you arrive and we started to feel more positive about our holiday.The main reception is spacious and has a lodge feel, so high marks for creating a believable environment.Check in was fairly slow, quite a big que   this is something you need to get used to on this holiday believe me!Your park tickets are allocated at reception, but no information about hotel facilities including internet access or pool area was given at that time. I suspect they did not have enough staff on reception to cope with arrivals and time was a premium   its not a major issue, just an observation, but attention to detail none the less.The room was located about a 5 minute walk from the main building in one of the lodges and its a pleasant walk down through well maintained woodland.The entrance to the lodge was a bit of a shock   very tired looking, peeling and very chipped paint everywhere and not very clean   our room was on the 1st floor up two flights of stairs   try man handling heavy suitcases up with no lift option   not good either.The room also looked tired and in need of refurbishment inside   I have stayed in B&B that was infinitely better. The bathroom was adequate with postage stamp bath towels.The room had chipped furniture and two double beds for 4 of us   I had watched a promo video of the lodge before arriving that showed the kids with bunk beds and a curtain to be drawn for additional privacy, so this was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that, the room was spacious enough.One thing which was more to do with who else was in the other rooms     there is a LOT of noise up and down the corridor at night, which was problematic in getting our 3 y o daughter off to sleep at night.We arrived around teatime so we decided to head into the Village to get something to eat. The Hard Rock Caf   always has an appeal, so we chose to eat there.As a side point, you learn very quickly that you will sped a fortune eating out. A meal for 4 people (2 children, 2 adults) costs on average 80 Euros with a couple of drinks. That   s for one main course for adults and children   s menu which is a main plus sweet. The furniture inside looks tired and needs renewing upgrading. Other than that, the quality of food was excellent and the staff were friendly with quick and attentive service. Next day was our first day at the park and we decided to take in the main Disneyland Park. As one other reviewer said, it looks really impressive as you walk up and you get a sense of something special, however this is a veneer over something that desperately needs some kind of update. The park did not seem that clean and the toilets were at best horrible and mostly disgusting. One did not have any means to dry your hands (Pizza Planet).I could write about each individual attraction, but here is the good the bad and the ugly as far as family rides are concerned, its pretty much a given that the main rides (Space Mountain etc are really impressive). GOOD: Pirates of the Caribbean     well thought out and a great atmosphere. BAD: Autopia     it would look more at home in Butlins and for that matter a Butlins in need of upgrading. UGLY: Peter Pans Flight     we had to que over 40 minutes for this garbage     the ride was out of commission on two occasions we went there (as were a number of rides that seemed to have lot of technical issues). The ride takes you above the rooftops in a very jerky and almost ready to break down fashion. Maybe OK 13 years ago, but has no place in what should be the magic of Disney     this promised so much     the leaflet says        hop on to a Pirate ship and fly off on an unforgettable journey to Never Land    unforgettable right enough and should be called    never ever again land   .The other thing that takes getting used to is the ques, the constant barging, people almost running between rides like their life depended on it and people pushing in.

The food inside the park is expensive beyond belief     talk about milking a captive audience     Disney     you should be ashamed of yourself      ..All in all I would rate this park a 2 10.Disney Studios park is marginally better, although the    Slinky Dog Zigzag Spin     enjoy the thrills on this zigzag coaster    (from the leaflet) involved a 40 minute que for less than 60 seconds on the ride itself!!!! That   s completely crazy     it seems that people (us included) as happy to que huge amounts of time to go on rides that are less than average.The car stunt show was brilliant and our 6 y o Elliot loved seeing Lightning McQueen in the flesh     the stunts were spectacular and it lives up to its billing.Each morning we had to que for around 20 minutes just to get into the restaurant for breakfast     how can that be? I have never ever stayed in a hotel and had to que up for breakfast. Too many guests and the facilities are unable to cope.Would be go back ? Absolutely never in a millions years, unless of course many of the above issues were addressed.Value for money?

The place was so big and magical, with friendly Disney characters wandering around, happily taking photos with you and having a friendly chat.How times have changed! I went recently with friends and I failed to see any Disney characters walking around taking casual photos with their young fans. A few big rides were shut and strangely, there was an old Michael Jackson 3D experience which was (frankly) a huge waste of time! The place seemed shabby, the staff indifferent. To top off this disappointing experience, me and my friends were harassed by a group of males in one of the queues for a ride! It's hard to find anything  magical  about horrible blokes inappropriately touching you saying disgusting things to you in a confined space. We complained to a member of staff and pointed out the offenders and the reaction we received was shocking. It was plain that this member of staff couldn't care less!Based on my personal experience, I wouldn't recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone.

1658,119367950,2,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We booked to go to Paris from 12th 14th, arriving in the morning and flying home in the evening so we had 3 full days at the parks. We also booked the half board meal plan, so we did not have to worry about searching for somewhere to eat our evening meals. Things started to go wrong once we got to the hotel, where we discovered work was being done on our lodge, right outside our bedroom window, the workmen   s faces were right at our window, so we felt we had no privacy. The keys given to us were very temperamental and at one point we were locked outside our room for over half an hour, eventually we were given new keys. The bath and shower did not work, so we were unable to bath shower the whole time we were there, which was very uncomfortable and there were no drinks facilities or anywhere to store cold drinks either. I have never been in a hotel that does not offer either a fridge or kettle, and for the amount it costs to stay at Disney, to not have basics was unsatisfactory. In the brochure and at the hotel it says that there are Disney channels for the children to watch in the rooms, the English Disney channel did not work in our room, much to the disappointment of our children, only the news and the information channel worked.On our second night I mentioned my thoughts to the concierge hoping that some of this may be sorted out for us, especially the bath water, however nothing was done and we received no apology from management, we were just given a booklet to fill in for internal use only asking about our stay in Disney and what we liked best.As I mentioned earlier we booked the half board menu, which I deeply regretted. In the past I had heard that the food was fantastic, I now realise that they were talking about Disney land in America! Paris may share the name Disney, however I feel that the standards are extremely miles apart. Our children did not enjoy their meals and the only fresh items on my husbands and my plate were the meat. The vegetables were either out of a tin or had previously been cooked and re heated, they were soft and soggy, the service in the hotel was good though. For the second meal we decided to eat in the Disney Village to see if the food was any better, yet another reget! We went to the Steakhouse, which looked to be of a high standard. Table booked for 9.15, seated at 9.30 and were brought our drinks at 10.10pm. The kids were served their main meal before we were even served our starter. Both our daughters left their meals, one was raw in the middle the other was just horrible to taste and when our starters arrived, Cesar salad, we were extremely let down, lettuce which was old and the leaves were brown, half a cherry tomato and parmesan shavings with a little dressing. We sat and waited ages for them to be taken away, the waiter looked at the plates and could see we were not happy and not eating but did nothing to care why? My husband and I ordered steak, as we were in a steakhouse we had thought that it should be good, how wrong we were. The waiters decided to serve the table next to us their steaks even though they had arrived much after us, they saw we were looking and not too happy so they brought two of the steaks to us, as my husband started to cut the steak, he saw it was well done, he had asked for medium rare, so the waiter took one off the next table and swapped the steaks, I cut into mine and that was not right either, again the waiter just swapped with another person on the next table, none of us could believe our eyes. As one of my daughters had not eaten any of her food, I gave her some of my steak, which she nearly choked on as it was so chewy, most of the meals were left.We then asked for desert hoping that may be edible, I asked if on my crumble I could have custard instead of ice cream, he said custard is for children and no I could not have it, even though it was available. The only item that was wholly consumed was the Ben and Jerrys ice cream, a few bread rolls and our drinks. When we went to pay for our drink and hand in our meal tickets, I tried to speak to a woman their about our meal and she just looked at me and walked away, the receipt showed the meal came to 95 euro and if I had not already pre paid I can say that I would not have paid for that shambolic meal. I prepaid   160.00 for two evening meals which I deeply regret and will think twice about it in the future. I would just like to say that my experience at Disneyland Paris was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, it was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime, but we could not wait to get home, the service has let the Disney name down, I was hoping to come back from my holiday to have lots of great things to say however I feel that the bad far outweighed the good.The best part of the trip were the studios. I think that it should have the disney name stripped, as I am sure Disney himself would be ashamed if he took a visit there, it is awful to say we learn by mistakes, mine was a costly one, the good thing is we have some great photos!",Disneyland_Paris,3,hotel disnei book room park stai dai food meal wait breakfast disneyland time kid pari

I was really looking forward to coming back after almost 10 years since my first visit and was expecting it to be the best one. Unfortunately it was complete opposite, for double price it was the worst park we visited this summer.What went wrong? First some of the major attractions were closed. We were not even told at the entrace, you have to go back all the way to the attraction to find out it is closed. 4 attractions were closed.Another pretty bad thing was food. All the smaller outside stands were closed so only few inside places were opened. All places were packed and the service was so inefficient. When there were 4 people remainig in the line it took 20minutes to get to the counter and then another 5minutes waiting for cheeburger where you even have to put the sauce on yourself! What a joke and rip off for the price.Also unfortunately in 10 years almost nothing changed there were just two new attractions. And some attractions were looking pretty outdated, example, these days 3D cinema is pretty normal thing and in Disneland you get almost 25years old show with MJ and they expect you to go Wooow from that? Overall the park needs to improve a lot in terms of service and many attractions needs to be refurbished. Not sure if we ever go again, as said there are much better parks with lots more fun in Europe! Even my girlfriend who is not picky and rarely complains was pretty upset and disappointed.

To see some of the Disney stars we had to ask how and when they were available and to arrange to see more than one in one area we had to pay    34 for a meal for adults and    18 for children in Mickeys Restaurant so they could have their photoa taken with stars. In the stores they concentrated on Mickey and Minnie mouse and there were very limited articles on things like Woody and Buzz and shelves were not stocked from the previous day..The maps provided were inaccurate and we walked aound for ages trying to find the Arena where the Stunt Cars performed ( The best thing there!) as there were no staff members to advise us. Nothing was organised and we were shoved out of the way queueing to enter the gates at opening time. four gates and at least one thousand people pushing and shoving not queueing and my gt.grandson of 6 years was pushed to the ground by a woman and looked angry when we shouted.All in all a disapointing and expensive trip.

Unfortunately it felt as though the ethos of Disney had evaporated leaving just the signage. Rides didn't open, broke down repeatedly or closed early. Weeds grew from some of the building in the lands and on Main Street. Many cracks and pits were evident in the pavement flooring, posing significant trip hazards. Smokers freely wandered around with no attempt by staff to restrict smoking to the designated areas. We had a good meal with excellent service in the Yacht Club and had saved the California Grill in our hotel for the last night, Thursday. What a mistake! The service was grim from the start.The prawns ordered by my friend smelt strange. In short both my friend ran from the table some minutes later to be sick in her room and I, having tried half a prawn, woke up ill at 3.45 next morning and still feel sick today (Monday). However what shocked me was the waiter's behaviour. He was annoyed that we dare complain and didn't want to order pudding. He avoided our table and was exceptionally off hand with us.Then, when you just wouldn't expect it to get any worse, we were unable to leave on time in the morning because there was nobody on any of the ground floor reception, bagage or concierge desks, although I had been able to speak to someone on the phone from the room. I found a porter down a corridor who immediately ran to find someone for us. By then there were 16 people in a queue for non existant service.

1664,118559354,2,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We visited the parc with our friends and their two children aged 7 and 5, the children were really looking forward to the visit as were we.Areas that were poor in my opinion:At least one major ride in every land was shut or cordened off.The staff were decorating & painting many parts of the part while it was open, it was a bit like a building site in many places.We only saw two disney characters in the entire parc in an 8 hour period and the queues for the children to have a photo with them were large, the children were very disappointed about this, if the characters aren't there what distinguishes this from any other amusement park??? Nor is this as per the adverts that Disney put out on the tv.The games arcade near the StarTours ride was unstaffed and out of the 10 Euros we put into the machines (which are 1 Euro a game) we got 3 games. The machines ate the rest and there was no one to go to complain. Suggest you avoid these machines.Many of the food stalls were shut in each of the lands, again this gave the parc the general feel of being only half open and left us with the option of taking the children to restaurants, which cost more.You need to pay attention not just to the parc opening hours but the ride opening hours as many of the rides shut an hour before the parc does so you end up with very disappointed children when they find out the rides are already shut.Be careful when getting onto the rides, one of the Disney staff pulled down the bar on the Pinocchio ride straight onto my knee as he couldn't be bothered to check that I was properly in the ride, when I shouted in pain he just ignored me and moved the car along.To sum up, the children were overall happy enough, but we could have taken them to any theme park for that, we were expecting more from Disneyland.

This however, was my first visit with two little boys, 7 and 4, and as such the experience was very different but no less magical ! The rides are still fantastic but the reality of hour long queues for nearly everything (and this on the two worst days weather wise of the entire summer!) explain the title of my review above. We bought 2 day 2 park tickets for each of us and spent Friday 26th and Saturday 27th August working our way around Disneyland and the Disney Village. We were experienced enough to fully exploit the Fastpass system by pulling tickets for a busy ride the second we arrived on park but this facility is limited and only available on certain rides. Then we were onto our first attraction and the interminable queues !It is very important to set your expectations for the visit. It is impossible to do everything so do not even try and if you are visiting with small children then you must plan your visit accordingly, so sadly for us adults there was no Indy, no Space Mountain and in the Disney Village we just stared but could not touch most of the great rides on display but that just means more thrills when the boys are older. That said there are still plenty of attractions to amuse families with small children particularly in Fantasyland and with little boys Buzz Lightyear is a must so make sure you pull a Fastpass and come back at your predefined time to go top of the queue.Now for my list of quibbles... On the first day on park I took note of the buffet restaurant near the Aladdin attraction and suggested to Deirdre that we would check it out for dinner on our second night. Unfortunately when we casually walked into the empty foyer of the asian buffet on the Saturday night we were refused entry to the BUFFET because we did not have a reservation.When I asked where I could make a reservation I was told that I could make a reservation for the following night !! at the reservations desk near the entrance to the park. It wasn't just the refusal but the supercilious nature of it after spending    500 on admission tickets that hurt the most. I felt so bad about it that I stopped by the customer care reservations desk on my way out of the park and mentioned to a chap called Michael there that a simple note on the entrance to the buffet restaurant explaining the need for a reservation might have saved my blushes and embarrassment at the hands of the Maitre'D in training who had left such a poor impression on us moments earlier. I was quickly reminded that it was Paris I was and not Disneyland proper when Michael began to defend the indefensible behavior of his colleague and I reminded him that as the customer I was merely suggesting how they might improve their  product offering  by a better communication strategy! Or maybe all I wanted was a  Sorry Sir hope we didn't ruin your evening too much  and then send me on my way with a pat on the head.Good job I didn't mention to Michael that most of the bathroom facilities we had encountered that day were filthy or he may have handed me a bucket and a mop! Oh and one final thing we didn't get a chance to meet Mickey Mouse in person during our visit but the family of very large mice ( the bubonic plague carrying variety!) that crossed our path as we came out of the turnstiles at 21:00 on Saturday 27th August 2011 more than made up for it ...

1689,115930693,2,2011-7,United Kingdom,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO DISNEY PARIS DURING PEAK SEASON!!! Please listen to this advice as you will be incredibly disappointed if you don't! The crowds are so vast that even if you hold your child's hand it is possible at times that they will be dragged away and lost. The best rides aimed at 6 year olds have queue times of between 60 90 mins and NO FAST PASS. You will simply not be able to ride on the best, most exciting rides unless you are willing to endure the wait with your little one. You will not get to have a picture with Mickey or Minnie even if you see them unless you are incredibly lucky. They get mobbed and have to have several minders who regularly drag them away behind the scenes as the costumes were getting damaged and abused. (We ended up having to queue for 30 mins just to get a picture!)Unless you have breakfast at 7am you are unlikely to get a table at breakfast at your hotel without queuing for 5 10 mins.The auditoriums for shows fill up incredibly fast with people queuing for 30 45 mins before to get the best seats. If you don't queue your kids will most likely get stuck behind adults and have a restricted view. This happened to us EVERY TIME. The best views of the parade in Disneyand Park again fill up very quickly and unless you secure your spot by quite simply sitting on the edge of the path for 45 mins your kids will not be able to see much.OVERALL.... peak season tickets are a huge waste of money and you will end up exhausted and frustrated. Yes our kids had a great time but it could have been far more exciting if we had gone when the crowds were much smaller. Only go to Disney during peak season if you are willing to queue for EVERYTHING.Oh and disregarding the time of year be prepared for everything costing DOUBLE. This morning a very small slice of cheese pizza cost us around   5... YES   5!!!!!!!If you have the money and children who can withstand a longer flight please visit Disneyland Florida. I have been to both and Paris is a pathetic and overpriced comparison!!!TIPS:Bring sandwhich bags. There is bread, butter, ham and cheese available at breakfast. Make the sandwhiches at the table and slip them into your sandwhich bag (within a backpack  large bag) when no one is looking. It will save you loads of money.Ask for a kettle from reception and take the coffee and sugar from breakfast. Fill up a clean baby bottle with milk and store it in your room in cold water. Coffee costs around   4   5. This will save you loads.Buy treats  sweets for the kids before you go and pack in your suitcase. Buy large bottles of water and pack a bottle of squash. Put it all in a backpack.All the kids TV is in French (Playhouse Disney.....). If you can buy a portable DVD player (great for the Eurostar too!) and bring the lead to connect it to the TV. The TVs in our hotel were brand new LCD and have all the connections. We got an 8 inch LG with a six hour battery. Most have a 2 hour battery... choose wisely!Stay at the Sequioia Lodge. It is the best 'budget' hotel set in a pretty and tranquil forrest. Very close to Disney Village and easy to walk. It is the only budget hotel with a swimming pool.Hotel guests can enter the park at 9am so if you can get up earlier you have an hour before the park officially opens. (makes no difference during peak times really as there are so many Disney guests!)Visit Mickey's cafe. The food is overpriced and not that nice but the Disney characters are awesome and this experience made our holiday amazing for the kids. BOOK THIS EARLY WITH YOUR HOTEL CONCIERGE. Queue times can exceed 45mins for a table otherwise.If you have a buggy get a bicycle chain and padlock. You will have to leave your buggy at the railings of many, many rides and so many look the same yours may very well get stolen! Pack waterproof clothing. The heavens opened today and pathetic and flimsy ponchos cost   10 each!!!Get your Euros put on a debit style card from Thomas Cook.

It's not the same when you ride it in the morning.   A lot of the rides were not working and we were very disappointed.   The staff in the rides are not friendly.

Generally, the park is not like it was before, it needs a lot of maintenance and cleaning. Rules and regulations across the park need to be reviewed, like some priority or rules need to be set for small children so that they don't get squashed or their places taken by inconsiderate grown ups.

We've been to Disney World in Florida numerous times so we did enjoy seeing the differences in well known rides like Space Mountain and the Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, this park has numerous flaws that Disney World does not and thankfully does not. Employees are content to engage each other in conversation while ignoring you. The typical Disney friendliness was something we saw maybe half the time, (It's Paris, I guess that should be expected.) We couldn't get a Fast Pass reader to recognize one of our tickets and the guy manning the machines was content to say he could not help. Until of course you act like a Parisian and refuse to take no for an answer. Funny how all of a sudden he can fix the problem.What really surprised us was the dirt and how unclean it was. I can understand how that can occur as everyone smokes and their cigarette butts end up everywhere. But, even the bathrooms were filthy. I did see one young lady attempting to pick up the paper on the floor, well at least every third piece of paper.Behavior was allowed that you wouldn't see at any Disney Park in the US. Multiple people cutting the line, for starters. On the Tower of Terror the Disney employee stood there discussing with the woman her cutting for a good five minutes. Everyone around her said her group cut so what's to discuss? At WDW, she would have been tossed, in Paris they debate the issue and she and her family stroll away.I do have to say it was amusing seeing the man take a siesta undisturbed by any form of security on the grass next Main Street, a woman attempt to take her sleeping 6 month old onto the spinning tea cups and the 4 year old on the carousel snapping pictures with no seat belt on because the ride operator didn't bother walking the rest of the ride to make a safety check.Lunch was fine at a counter service location, even if no one bothered to clear their own trash. Perhaps Europeans visiting Disneyland Paris are more accepting of the pushiness on line and the complete lack of anything resembling personal space. I ride the NYC subway so I can handle the occasional need for close quarters. But 10 hours of being pushed with little regard for social norms is tiring.If you are an American visiting Paris with children and you've been to Disney World, please don't expect that experience when contemplating a day trip.

Save your money and go to real castles, even if you have children.When I visited, a very large part of the park was closed (including rides) for 'renovations for your future enjoyment', which of course was not advertised when purchasing our tickets. Nor was there any signage in the park about closures, which meant that you would walk down numerous streets only to come to dead ends and have to backtrack constantly. It was extremely frustrating.The rides were minimal   only 3 'big thrill' rides and not that many that I saw for children, either, there were absolutely no carnival games where you could play to win prizes, not a single Disney character in sight, not enough restaurants for the mass of people (even in non peak eating times). As another reviewer so accurately described it, this was simply a giant Disney themed shopping mall. The shops didn't even have much variety between each other, either   they all carried essentially the same merchandise with only a slight variation and the consumer panic in every shop was sickening.Our assessment of the entire experience was very poor. We expected more from Disney. If you absolutely must come here, don't bother unless your children are six years old or younger and you're interested in losing a ton of money on naff Disney merchandise and being nagged all day by your children to buy things for them, because that's all your entertainment options.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Short feedback: This was the WORST experience we have ever had bar none at a park and it was 10X the price of some of the regional parks we visit all the time in the DC area. For starters there are really on 7 8 rides in the WHOLE place. The rides are super short   the merry go round went for 2 minutes!!!!!!!! We timed it. Took 1 hour to get on, 5 minutes for them to load us and in 2 minutes we were off! Second everything has a LONG line ... at least 90 minutes. The rides also suck! They are not that interesting...

We used the Fast Pass at 12:45 and we received tickets for 6:45 at night. Fast Pass? The bathroom facilities were absolutely disgusting: run down, flooded and soiled with 10 15 minute waits to use a toilet...not a big deal as my son's 4 year old bladder is very patient.

Be forewarned, this park is only renting the Disney name and tries to mimic it with a similar layout and rides but is in no way a comparison for Disney Orlando.Oh, and it only cost us    160 for three to get in for this lovely experience.

1710,109099465,2,2010-11,United States,"I had done a significant amount of preliminary research prior to our visit to ensure I understood what to expect and to be as prepared as possible. Many of our park experiences, were fun and entertaining, with some exceptions, notably the food.I fully understood, expected and accepted the especially high prices. The terrible quality and limited offerings, however created growing frustration. It seems that rather than cook food of the region (even fast food), they seem to be attempting to offer a American style fast food concept that is worse than what I see served in American school cafeterias but for prices that are extremely high, even when you are expecting them to be over inflated. it was cold when we visited and it seemed that at all levels the food service experienced problems. Any baked goods, which might look like they should be warm were in fact ice cold on the 2 times we purchased from carts with heat lamps. We selected the Plaza Gardens reluctantly one day after reviewing it's offerings at 2 pm. Our 6pm reservation provided an experience that seemed like we were literally picking over the scraps leftover from some other part of the park, with no service and a huge bill. It was the most disgusting meal I had in 2010. The only exceptional meal in our 4 day trip, was at the Agrabah Cafe, open for a just a few hours on one of our days. While perhaps not for young children, it offered the only fresh and delicious food I'd seen in a peaceful location. It was a great escape and even though astoundingly expensive, wished was an option every day of our visit.Customer Service also seems to be a foreign concept at the park. I don't ask for much, and am very sensitive to not be a self righteous American. One stand out experience occurred on our last day when our hotel concierge suggested that we could purchase any souvenirs in the park and ask for them to be held at the store until you leave the park. We asked the store clerk twice about this policy before making our purchases. When handed our bags we asked again for the items to be held. We were told that we needed to ask at the beginning of the transaction, which is precisely what we had done, with what appeared to be a clear understanding from the cast member. Frustrated, we asked for assistance at City Hall where a very nice cast member apologized and indicated that anything is possible and that if we return to the store they will be able to hold our purchases. They again insisted they could not and stated we could use the package storage service outside the park, which we reluctantly went to, only to learn it would cost 3   , which is so unacceptable given that it should have been held for free several minutes earlier as we had requested. Frustrated for feeling like some kind of stupid fools, we eventually just returned the purchases to avoid carrying them all day, repurchasing what we could before our departure. There were many other negative experiences marring our vacation.I think it is acceptable to be expensive, but never to feel you're being blatantly ripped off.

1713,106896552,2,2011-4,United Kingdom,"If you've never been to a Disney Park and are thinking about your first visit then don't read on. However   if you've previously been to the parks in America and you've now been to the park in Paris, I imagine you may nod your head reading this.This place shouldn't really be called 'Disneyland Paris'. If they were being accurate when naming this it should be called 'Theme Park based on the one in Orlando   but run by the French'.Having been to the parks in Orlando on a couple of occasions it has to be said this park is a very poor relation   the black sheep of the family.My wife, 6 year old son and I stayed for 3 nights 4 days over the recent Bank Holiday weekend and to be honest I was disappointed. Where to Start?Staying at a Disney Hotel 'entitles' you to additional 'Magic' hours in the parks   although it is only for the Magic Kingdom and not the Studios. The extra hours are a waste of time. On our first day there we got to the park at just after 0900   1 hour into the extra hours   and nothing was open or operating!! There was nowhere open to get a coffee, no shops open to part with your cash and the only areas you could get to were Main Street and Fantasyland   all the other areas were roped off with a glum looking 'Cast Member' stood there stopping anyone from exploring. Even though you could get into Fantasyland (the other side of the castle) no rides operated until shortly before 1000   WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!! Certainly not what happens in Orlando.The quality of the rides was generally poor. Some of the rides that you sit on a train for and go on a journey (as were all rides) were over in less than 60 second (the Carousel in Fantasyland only goes around twice before it stops and you have to get off!!) There was little attention to detail in some of the rides. The scenery on all of the indoor rides seemed to stop at eye level   when you looked up all you could see were ceiling panels   which weren   t always there. Also despite the parks opening to everyone at 1000 a lot of the shows in the parks (Cinemagique etc) don't have their first showing until 1200. Something we couldn't understand.The attitude of the 'cast members' wasn't particularly enthusiastic either. On the first evening we tried to get a table at the restaurant in Frontierland at a few minutes past 2000 (the park closes at 2100)   we tried this one because every other eatery in the park was already closed   despite the restaurant only being at best a third full we were told in no uncertain terms that they were not serving anyone else tonight. Aslo the staff are in no hurry to serve you either. We stopped for some ice cream at the ice cream parlour on Main Street. When we began queuing, there was 1 person in front of us. 15minutes later when they had served that 1 person with 3 scoops of ice cream   there was a queue out the door   something that was to be a regular occurrence.There is no two ways about it   the parks are incredibly expensive for food and souvenirs. When in the Magic Kingdom we stopped at Casey   s at the top of Main Street for a quick bite. I had a cheesey hot dog with soft drink (no souvenir cup) and it cost   8.00   it certainly was not worth it. Among some of the souvenirs we looked at we wanted some photo frames for some of the pictures we had. A plain wooden frame   with tiny Mickey Mouse ears embossed in each corner for a 6  x 4  photo was 15 Euros!!! I always expect theme parks to be a bit more expensive   but the cost of things here is ridiculously high   at least Dick Turpin wore a mask!!!Although you wouldn't call the place unclean, it is certainly nowhere near as clean as it's counterpart in Orlando. It's not uncommon to find black sticky marks over the pavements where drinks have been spilt days previously and nothing been done.Also the park tolerates 'Street Merchants' hassling customers just outside the park entrance. Several times men offering Caricatures for a price tried to make a move towards our son to get him to go over. Plus in the evening there were vendors who laid out a small towel and were selling very cheap and tacky souvenirs   none of it Disney related. Not sure this would have been tolerated in Orlando!!That said, if (like I do) you have a wife and child that are mad for Disney then it is worth a quick visit (provided you have deep pockets!!) to let them get a 'fix' of the Disney Magic!!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Do these people think we can just pop back over when they've finished? Another popular ride, Big Thunder Mountain, was also out of action for two days due to technical difficulties. This was the nail in the coffin for me. As a result of these closures, there was around four or five hundred extra people in circulation . This made the place a lot busier and queueing a nightmare for everything except 'It's a small World' because nobody wants to go in there anyway!

In Florida our kids were asked if it was there first visit or there birthday. They we then given a badge to wear and staff would either wish them happy birthday or ask them how their day was when they passed them. We had all on getting a smile out of any of the staff3) The food is shockingly over priced and of a poor quality. We took food & drink into the park   I still don't know whether you are allowed or not but no one stopped us. This allowed us to have this during the day. We were in the park for 9 hrs and spend 22 euros on popcorn & ice creams.4) In Florida smoking is banned except in one or two smoking zones within the parks. In Paris smoking is not permitted on the rides but appears to be acceptable everywhere else. This simply is not good enough for a childrens theme park. Several times in the day we were queue for rides with our children while people smoked all around them.5) Organisation of things in the park is partilculary poor. Pluto came out to sign autographs, he was mobbed by about 30 kids why his  helper  lent against a wall 10 yards away completely not interested.

There was scafolding round the castle, broken pavements and faded paint on many rides. The food and drink in the parks was ridiculusly expensive,   7 for a pint of beer, nearly   4 for a diet coke in a bar,   12 for burger and chips,   4 for an icecream, etc, etc. The other European guests push and shove their way around the park, have no concept of personal space while queueing, don't bother to queue at all most of the time anyway, not even in the toilets. There are no characters walking around the parks and you have to queue for a meet and greet to get their autographs or a photo taken with them. The characters themselves were mostly lovely when we actually got to the front of the queues and this was the 4 year olds favorite part of the visit. There were big queues on lots of the rides and this was March.

We were booked in to the Sequoia Lodge which was just a few minutes walk from the Disney Village. The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable but they do not even supply tea and coffee making facilites in the rooms. We went to the swimming pool which was a nice size but not very warm. The changing facilities were hopeless with just two changing cubicles in the ladies (none at all in the mens), two toilets and a very small open changing area. They even charge 2 euros for a pool towel. The best thing about it was that the lockers were free.

We were all disappointed and I complained to the manager of the restaurant.  After telling him my complaints he shrugged his shoulders and said    do you want to have a word with the chief    , I said    yes    and went into the food area and pointed out to both to the manager and to one of the chief   s what food we had. Seeing me pointing out this food some of the other chiefs came out and joined the chef I was with. Immediately I felt intimidated. I looked around for the manager who brought me over, he had gone??? so I felt I should go and we all left feeling that no one had taken any notice of what I said . From then on the rest of my holiday went down the pan..I then noticed falts in everything from the overflowing bins , long que's i mean really long que's for every thing , the cold fast food , rude staff and poor customer service..Still today 3 months later on , I only have bad things to say about disney paris.

DL Paris looks like they built it 19 years ago and forgot about it. It suffers from a lack of maintenance (potholes in the sidewalks, siding falling off buildings, burned out light bulbs in marquees, peeling wallpaper), the hotel rooms don't meet the standards of the economy hotels in USA , serv ice is SLOW everywhere and there was garbage everywhere (it looked like it snowed cigarette butts and trash cans were overflowing). All of this comes at the normally high Disney prices. Why anyone would spend time here is beyond me.

I am a Disney fanatic and I was so excited to go to Paris Disneyland...it was a disappointment in a big way. First of all, before even getting into the park, we had trouble. We arrived by train and intended to take the shuttle to our hotel, the Radisson Blu. The area for the buses, shuttles, taxis and private cars is three narrow lanes right outside of the train station. You'd think it would have been easy for us but it was chaos. The shuttle pick up zones are not marked; no signs. Fortunately we overheard someone talking about our hotel and asked if they were waiting for the shuttle, which they were. It took at least a half an hour. Although we were right at the curb, all of a sudden about 20 people appeared and stared shoving onto the shuttle ahead of those that were waiting at the curb. The people packed on the shuttle and then the shuttle driver announced that he couldn't drive the shuttle with people standing. Funny how he didn't count or organize the people in any manner to avoid the angry, frustrated group that had to either rearrange, or get off the shuttle. Eventually all children were put on the laps of adults and the shuttle left. This whole ordeal was repeated again every time we took the Radisson Blu shuttle. This hotel is a Disney partner, so I would expect better service and organization. When we arrived at the park the next morning, it was cold and icy. I saw no one clearing snow or putting down gravel or sand to help prevent slips. It was treacherous walking on the steps and sidewalks. There were smokers EVERYWHERE. The amount of smoke was unbelievable and I just about passed out when I got a lungful while waiting in a crowd for a parade to start. Bad enough that I had to experience that as an adult, but really, come on, the cigarettes are burning at kid level all the time. This is obnoxious and unhealthy. Every restaurant we went in, with the exception of the Hakuna Matata, was beyond filthy. Overflowing garbage cans, tables with gobs of food on, around and under them and barely a cast member in sight cleaning up. You would NEVER see this at Anaheim or Orlando Disney parks. Walt would freak. It's not very magical. An interesting, if not disturbing thing I noticed was men in the women's restrooms. Several times I observed this. Maybe this is a European thing? I could understand it if a dad was escorting his very yound daughter, but what was the excuse for the dad with his 10 year old son???? Odd.The queue line up problem was not just in the parking and shuttle area. Since there seems to be a lack of staff, the lines for the rides were also unorganized and chaotic. I need to close on a positive note, so I'll say that as far as structural detail, Paris Disneyland is best. The castle is amazing, the gaslit walkways behind the Main Street stores are lovely and the Discoveryland decor is hands down better than the US Disney Parks.

1733,91995748,1,2010-12,United Kingdom,"We spent the 20 Dec 2010 in the Disney park and by lunchtime attractions were starting to close or break down. Getting about the park was ridiculous as the snow was turning to freezing slush and people with strollers were experiencing extreme difficulties. As parades and attractions were declining we left the park in early evening to find the hotel buses were suspended and we had to walk to our hotel   Sequoia Lodge. The next morning the snow outside the hotel was compacted and though slippery was suitable for walking on and reasonable dry. We walked to MGM studios and easily got in an into the first building which was populated with shops and food outlets. As we entered the park proper we found a sea of slush and many attractions closed. The open air Magic Carpet ride was open but it was left to the riders to clear the deep snow from the seats. People headed for the indoor attractions to find that under cover marshalling areas were closed on the pretext of dangerous snow levels on roofs and people were being advised to return later. The Aerosmith Roller Coaster became almost impossible to get onto. Fast pass booths were closed presunably because of weather damage. Animagiqe and Cinemagique were two indoor shows that were closed which upset hordes of people who were hoping for a half hour or more respite from the cold and wet. The only things that appeared to be functioning were where money could be taken. Shops and restaurants. These places became almost claustrphobically overpopulated. Snow ploughs were attempting to clear parade routes but were only succeeding in making pedestrian areas even more treacherous. By lunchtime we had enjoyed only 4 hot chocolates each and one ride for with our grand children so we gave up and retried the Disney park. Things were a little better but only for the mainly indoor attractions. Again there were lengthy delays as staff were not letting queues from getting too large by limiting those being let into the undercover walkways. It was impractical to queue outside of marshalling areas because of the large crowds wandering aimlessly. A slight easing of the weather enabled two of the parades to operate but the main wish of our grandkids to see princesses was not achieved. In the end we booked an expensive character dinner just to enable them to meet Mickey, Minnie and some of the animal characters.

They had made no effort to clean or sweep the floor which was like an ice rink. The pathways up to the entrance were not cleared of ice snow..I expected more from Disney.Anyway to cut a long story short I ended up in a french hospital for 7 hours on Christmas night on my own as my husband had to watch my children. In fairness the staff were very pleasant at Disney but I think they knew they were very wrong in not cleaning putting something down to make floor less slippery.It ruined my holiday but I think the children still enjoyed themselves...favourites were Buzz Lightyear ride, Peter pan ride and Live animated Stitch.Glad I looked on here before we went for tips..Don't catch shuttle from hotel to parks..walk along canal river at back of Disney..brings you out at Disney Village and much less hastle!Take rolls batches cheese and ham from buffet breakfast to eat throughout the day.we actually took a suitcase of our own food drink which was a life saver.Rainforest cafe was great to eat...everywhere is expensive but you get an experience with this too!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

In Disney Orlando when you walk in it feels magical, clean, colouful with uplifting disney music and different chracters everywhere. Here it was un magical, dirty, only a handful of characters and the music was dismal and not very loud. Staff looked like they didn't want to be there and didn't speak english very well so didn't understand what I was saying ( like another review said i'd expect that in any other part of france but not in Disney!). The american staff really get in character when you get on the rides, here they all lack any kind of enthusiasm and you can forget about going the extra mile. The rides are nothing compared to disney orlando, the food is awful and lacks variety and everything is seriously ripp off. Most of everything is in French so when watching a show it means nothing to you or they have one chracter who is french and one is english but again you can't follow the story.

Generally, the experience just  wasn't Disney . For example:1. I found everything to be totally over priced. From the moment we arrived I got the impression it was all about how they could make the maximum amount of money out of us. For example, when you've spent   1400 on a 4 night stay, you don't expect to pay    7 for tea and coffee making facilities in your room. Come on, a   20 a night B&B in Blackpool puts them to shame on this one. Water over    2? A beer    4? A toffee apple    3? A hot dog, chips and soft drink    8? Good grief, at least Dick Turpin wore a mask!2. Considering France is the home of haute cuisine, the food on offer is appalling and over priced. Trying to eat healthily is well nigh impossible as it's chips with everything and God help you if you're a vegetarian.3. Why bother with a TV in your room if you're English? Every channel was in a foreign language, apart from the News and the info channel. Not at all child friendly for a supposedly child orientated resort.4. A member of staff was most rude and unhelpful. I simply asked for a carrier bag in The Disney Store as the one I had had ripped and was curtly told I couldn't have one unless I bought something. Considering the amount I spent to get there and was wearing a Disney Buffalo Bill Wild West Dinner Experience hat, that was pretty rich.5. My son was too small to go on the Space Mountain ride. The staff wouldn't even let him in the building to stand behind the barriers whilst I rode and insisted that he waited at the exit outside the building. In today's dangerous world, I found this reprehensibly unappreciative of child safety in the extreme.6. The Fast Pass ticket system needs a re think. Only being able to have one at any one time is illogical, really. For the same ride, that would make sense but not for different ones. Further, at one stage, the machines were issuing tickets for riding at 2145h at about 12 noon!7. Fast Passes aren't available on all popular rides. I couldn't get anywhere near the parachute and RC Rider rides, for example, without a 60 minute queue. Way too long, so I just didn't bother.8. Our hotel was in need of some TLC. Whilst not dirty, it just felt tired, in need of a lick of paint and general rejuvenation. (The Santa Fe).Overall, I am sorry to say that I was most disappointed with my visit.

1742,82472523,1,missing,United Kingdom,"June 2010I'll be honest from the off, this isn't normally my cup of tea but with a five and six year old on a French holiday we bit the bullet and took them to Disneyland expecting the magic to materialise   it died after 10 minutes of stepping into the place.Fortunately we'd bought our tickets at the campsite we were stayng at as the queues were ridiculously long just to get in. That aside, we still had to queue to get our baggage checked and then queue at every ride. This day cost us over   200 for a family of four and we got on about five rides, each lasting less than 2 minutes. I've had better value for money at the travelling fairground that comes once a year to our local park. Judging by the car park, I'd say the place was only half full but the crowds were horrendous   you could hardly walk about.The Disney shops were full of over priced tat, tons of it. There was absolutely nothing that you'd have wanted to buy. My kids had been given   5 to spend by a neighbour and they struggled to fnd anything that cheap. In the end they got a small sweetie dispenser each. The part we were in was more just glorified play area, what few rides there were were just basic rubbish you had to queue for a minimum of 30 minutes each time. We eventually left at 5pm and even the kids were glad. For such young kids their patience was remarkable but they really were not bowled over at all. When I ask them about their favourite part of the holiday to France it was the swimming pool at the camp site, swimming in the river and the funny tunnels at the war bit (Somme Museum).A total rip off.

If there was to be a fourth time, and there won't then it would be back to Newport Bay. I'll cover the hotel issues in another post.The park! Well it's Disney so the usual impressive Disney infrastructure always in evidence. We had a really heavy rainstorm on one morning and within minutes of the rain ending and the sun coming out there were people out sweeping the puddles away. The attention to detail always impresses, as does the general cleanliness of the place.However my main complaint is down to the number of attractions which were either closed, some for refurbishment others just closed, and others which just kept breaking down so you'd be turfed out after having queued. Too many to mention frankly.Now couple this with the balance seeming to have shifted unfavourably between the entertainment side and the retail  try and extract every last euro out of the visitor side  and then add in a healthy, or maybe should that be unhealthy dose of exchange rate misery, and it starts to leave a bit of a bad taste.Which nicely turns us to the food. Now Disney has never been particularly noted for fine dining, though Walt's always was, and indeed still is, the exception here. We had a first rate Sunday lunch on the half board plus menu and even the picky eaters in the family tried and supremely enjoyed everything, even things they thought they might not like. However away from Walt's, oh dear oh dear. You expect junk food, Casey's Corner is hot dogs for heaven's sake so nothing fancy. But soggy wet buns wrapped round ultra cheap dogs? Come on for that price I'd expect fine dogs not the rubbish that was served up on our visit, and way below what was served on previous stays.And so it went on, some places on the HB  list trying to be too fancy and just failing way way short. Others who have no pretensions to be fancy just being grim, eg Punta del Oro Tex Mex, found ouselves sticking to the floors and to the tables. YUK!Beaver Creek Tavern, fatty lamb, cold vegetables, dry and cold swordfish steak, desserts were good though.Parkside Diner, inedible main courses on the buffet, many adults were resorting to the childrens menu.Annettes Diner, another bright star and all three of us fully enjoyed our meal, they have been alongside Walt's as one of the more reliable places over the years.And then you try to go to places that you've visited before, eg Cowboy Cook out barbecue... closed, La Grange at Billy Bob's.... closed and so it went on. Les Cascadeurs... closed.Having paid for Half Board plus we were struggling to find suitable places to eat. We've found on previous visits that the best way to approach the parks is to take a sit down table service lunch early afternoon, that gives you a rest, and sets you up for the rest of the day. With what was on offer, assuming they were actually open, then this strategy was, for us a non starter.Of course it's not all a negative review, and some of the cast really do work hard to make people's visit enjoyable, but it seemed that they were struggling against a huge penny pinching strategy. For example first time ever with a long wait for It's a Small World. Why? Because only reduced number of staff on, and so those who were working refused to load every boat and were only loading alternate boats. I can however understand the logic why they were doing this, but it probably needed just one more cast member on duty. Yet the shops were packed with staff, extracting your money you see?So I'm sorry Disney Corporation, you charge a not inconsiderable sum for a visit, you've tipped over the edge from providing an attraction and turned it into a huge cash extraction process. Truth be known it was always that, but it is now just so blatant.I cannot recommend this venue until things change.I post very few reviews on here mainly due to time and only if I feel I have something to say, very often what I would say has already been said by others, so why take yp TS bandwidth.But DP needs a stinker of a review to get the act together.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We are great Disney fans and have traveled to parks worldwide and have already spent various vacations at the Resorts in Orlando and Anaheim. We have been very much excited to return to Paris, after been there in the opening week some years ago and the only thing we got in return was disappointment.We could not believe what was called Disney Village. We have never seen such a run down place before! It started with holes and giant cracks in the concrete everywhere, faded building facades, nothing to do for Kids, not even a playground was accessible. Entertainment was a not existent, even though they had announced a rock and roll party with car shows that day. Besides the Disney shops, little electric race cars which were not operated, a Balloon ride inside the resort lake for an additional 15 Euros per Person was available. We looked at some cars displayed and at 6pm a couple of kids started dancing on a little stage. To our disappointment, that was the entire party! We decided to have dinner at the rainforest cafe. No reservation required that evening so we got great seat but were also disappointed by the bad quality of food and the high prices. (For a starter plate and a fish course we paid 60 euros!) On our way out to the car we were held up by Souvenir sellers, trying to make us buy cheap metal Eifel towers. Next Morning we came back to enjoy the parks. We arrived there shortly before 10 am and the line in front of the security gates were so long, we decided to enter through the Walt Disney Studios. After a 20 minute wait and a baggage check that did not really include looking through bags, we were able to proceed through the ticket entrance into the Studio Park. The first ride we were heading to was the Crusher  s coaster. We arrived there at 10 Minutes after ten and were confronted with an 80 Minute wait. We thought this is because this attraction in new so we walked in to the RC Racer roller coaster. The line there appeared to be shorter so we got in. Right behind us a family was waiting and their child that got sick while standing in line. It took quite a while and lots of yelling until they got some help from the personnel working on this ride and were let out of the queue. The coaster was stopped during that episode because one of the operators had to assist the family. After a one Minute ride we attended a stunt show which was nice and around 11.30 we wondered back to the Disney Park  this was after we decided to proceed since the waiting time for all rides in the Studio Park were between 70 and 80 minutes, the Tower of terror had been closed due to technical problems and the crowd was getting exceptionally high. We entered the Disneyland Park and were literally shoved through Main Street. We were not able to walk freely so many people had been let in. We thought it was because it was lunch time and everybody had returned to main street  but we were proven wrong. Waiting time Big Thunder Mountain, was again 80 Minutes   and with fast pass option they asked you to return at 6.45 pm!!!. To make a long story short, after a lousy lunch, not being able to walk freely in the park due to the monstrous mount of people and incredible waiting times at every attraction (there was even an hour waiting time to hop onto the park train! Peter Pans Flight, had a waiting time over 120 minutes or, with fast pass, return at 9.30 pm   and it was noontime and so forth) we decided to go back to our hotel and to return in the evening when things were slowing down. We came back at 5 pm and encountered the same run of people, so we returned again at 7.30 pm. Discovery land was still overcrowded with waiting times at the attractions still over 80 minutes. So we went to see the Pirates of the Caribbean waiting time here, an acceptable 40 Minutes and it had just turned 8 pm. After a fun ride, we wanted to hop on to the Indianer Jones roller coaster, but with our arrival were informed that the ride had already been closed. After us asking why they close down the rides before they close down the Park at 10pm, the gentleman replied that he just does what he is told to and we should read the sings  and yes, there were signs that some attractions close before the park closes. Bad luck for us. We had payed full price ticket and all we got was a roller coaster ride, a stunt show, a unejoyable expensive lunch, a long afternoon at the hotel, 2 bus rides to return to the park and in the end a Pirates Ride and lot and lot and lots of people! One more thing we would like to mention at this point, the lighting at night was disastrous! All light came from little decoration lanterns but no lights in bushes, stairs or stronger street lights  I  m in my mid 30ies and I was not able to see the steps I had to go down properly! I can  t imagine what would have happened if your child would have run off or if it had gotten lost.  What really lifted this experience to something even more indescribable was the fact that we visited the Parks on September 11th and at this memorable date we had somehow expected a more elaborated precaution and security concept. We still cannot understand why so many people had been let in and if something would have happened we do not know how help could have been able to reach us. Thanks to this experience we did not return to the parks the next day, and will probably not return to Disney again. The sad thing, we met many other families also stating how disappointed they were and how their kids hated the Parks. We still don  t want to believe how disappointing this trip was, what a tourist trap Euro Disney is and how disrespectful we were treated!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The shops' and restaurants' prices were beyond rip off levels   of course we expected it to be expensive and with the exchange rate not being what it was 5 years ago we also made allowances for that, but 90 Euros for a family meal in what was effectively a MacDonalds with table service was really taking the mickey (no pun intended).

1748,76791397,1,missing,United Kingdom,"Having just returned form our 10th visit to Disneyland Paris I regret to say that it feels like the Magic has finaly died. The Park itself could be a wonderful place, as it used to be, but it is now a run down shabby and poorly managed reflection of its former self. Our 6 day visit with a young child was beset by many problems which are summarised here. 1. People were smoking everywhere in the park except in the rides themselves. Although the restaurant areas are supposed to be non smoking, people were smoking in the seated areas around every restaurant we visited and around all the walkways and playgrounds. We never once witnessed any staff do anything about it. Are the Disneyland Paris Management unaware of the hazards of cigarette smoke or Disney's no smoking policy or do they simply not care? 2. The park is in a very poor state of repair with numerous holes and trip hazards in the walkways, bits of rides and decor missing or broken, rides breaking down and toilets in a disgraceful state with many blocked causing long waiting times. The riverboat was taken out of service while we were there and we had to wait 45 minutes while the Pirate ride was fixed after breaking down. Most of the rifles in the shooting gallery (costing 2 euros a go) had sights missing. Numerous faults and breakages in and around the haunted house. The pirate ship is presumably in such a state of disrepair that people are no longer allowed on it. The high rope bridge was covered in scaffolding. 3. There are now no shows on at the Chaparral Theatre, Fantasyland Stage and Castle stage and the only show on in the Hyperion is the African drummers who used to play outside of the Hakuna Matata restaurant. 4. Queue management now seems to be done to make it easy for the staff rather than fair for the visitors. We were at the front of the queue for attractions several times only to find ourselves not admitted first or directed to the back of the ride. 5. Opening times at some of the better value restaurants have been reduced and now close early in the evening. Most of the restaurants do not display their opening times so you can walk across the park for a meal only to find your chosen restaurant closed.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1749,76287435,1,missing,United States,"My fourteen year old daughter and I recently spent one of our six days in Paris at Disneyland. What a waste of a day. I guess we assumed that Disneyland Paris would offer an experience similar to what we have enjoyed a half dozen times in Orlando. Boy, were we wrong.First, we arrived from Paris by train right at opening time only to discover that there were just two people conducting security checks for all the people exiting the RER station. Seems to me that Disney customer service should be able to figure out that they might need more staff at busy times. So this was that start to our day: a thirty minute wait to have someone check my backpack.The staff that IS working at Disneyland Paris obviously does not benefit from the same training that their colleagues in America do. They were ornery, disheveled, inattentive, and     quite honestly   most appeared to be a bit daft. On several occasions, they even left their posts. Once while we were boarding    Rockin    Rollercoaster    and twice on    Space Mountain   , we were left to make our way to the trains and load ourselves in. This happened over and over so, consequently, we saw time and time again the rides leave the station with empty seats. More serious, perhaps, was that fact that on one of our turns on    Space Mountain   , no one ever checked to see if our harnesses were fastened. A major safety breech, I would imagine.The park itself was very    tired    looking, dirty, and in need of repair. The plaza in front of Disney Studios has holes in it where the concrete has worn away, buildings and rides need either a good scrubbing or a coat of paint, and the bathrooms were disgusting. I   ve always been so impressed with the attention to detail in Orlando. No such attention to detail is evident in Paris.And then there   s the smoke. Dear French People, have you not heard of lung cancer? You NEED to STOP smoking! And Dear Disneyland Paris, if you   re going to advertise the park as    Smoke Free   , it had better be. And if you   re going to have rules against smoking in line, you need to enforce them. The smoke was awful.On the up side,    Space Mountain    is (in my opinion) far better than the ride in Orlando.    Rockin    Rollercoaster    is just as good, although they don   t use the same recording studio setup for the ride, and    Tower of Terror    was fine.The one word I would use to describe our day at Disneyland Paris is disappointing. We were looking forward to enjoying a day like we have so many times at Walt Disney World and it just didn   t happen. If it tells you anything, I spent part of my day today looking for the address where I can write Disney CEO Robert Iger. The opening part of the letter to him will read:   Dear Mr. Iger, When was the last time you visited Disneyland Paris? From what I can tell, I   m pretty sure it has been a while.

1750,75736057,1,missing,United States,"Spent 2 days here with our children, 7 & 8. This park is HORRIBLE. First of all, the park allows guests to smoke virtually anywhere. One smoking area was designated RIGHT OUTSIDE A CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND!!!! Not that it matters    no one seems to pay attention to the no smoking signs. Probably because no employees back this up. Which is the 2nd of all    employees are VERY hard to find in this park. Except where they are loading or unloading a line. Here, they are very friendly. But sssssllllllooooowwww    which is the 3rd of all. I don't know if it's the culture or just laziness, but employees seemed a little lost on loading and unloading. On a good note, just about every employee spoke some English. The biggest disappointment came when Toy Story 3 Playland wasn't open yet    when it had been advertised as being open in the US.  Invited guests  only. Tell that to a 7 year old who had spent the last month dreaming of seeing it. Guest relations was a joke and outright lied to us    swore there were no people in that closed area when you could see them with your own eyes.

Teacups, a car ride and a (Broken) carousel On all of these rides adults were pushing in front of children to get on!!!! If they are 1.2 meters they can get on the runaway train ride.The queues are ridiculous throughout and the 'attractions' are very widely spaced in order to give you the opportunity to pass (literally) hundreds of shops selling the same things. To be fair, the security warned us when we joined the 40 minute queue to get the bags searched  Keep smiling because you'll be queing all day . He was not wrong.The park was busy (as I expected) but I was astounded by the number of adults without kids in a theme park aimed at children. I was even more astounded when they were scrabbling to get on childrens rides and queue jumping past said children. Whether the Disney 'magic' prevents people observing civilised norms of behaviour i don't know. The adults pushing past children was not just limited to the rides, or the laughable attractions (For a laugh you have to see Pocahontus' garden, a couple of slides and seats   'weather permitting'!!!)Food is appalling.

1753,75244221,1,missing,United States,"We were just in Disneyland Paris on a Monday in August. The whole experience was a disappointment from beginning to end. To get into the park took at least 45 minutes, in three very disorganized queues first to go through security, then to get tickets, then to get into the park. The main problem with Disney is that it's far too crowded, at least in the summer. The park is much smaller that its Florida counterpart, so with so many people milling about it's hard just to maneuver the walkways. Obscenely long lines. And nearly every line had a line jumper! Park not as clean as in Florida, and the staff certainly not as friendly. Just before 6:00 p.m. my husband waited in line for fish and chips at Toad Hall restaurant. When he arrived at the counter, at 5:58, the manager literally closed the door in his face and said,  We're closed.  He was the last one in line and they could have easily closed the door after serving him. We had a crappy sandwich for dinner someplace else instead. Now the the good: the rides were all fun, especially It's a small World, the Fairy Tale boat ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. And the parade at 7:15 was great. But nearly all lines were 30 minutes or more; we averaged only one ride per hour. However, although I did not enjoy the day, my kids definitely did. They have good memories, so it wasn't a complete waste. I'll never go back to DPL.

1754,74253879,1,missing,Canada,"Having jsut come back from DLP I was amazed that the scores of reviews I read on the web never told you what you really need to know if going to DLP with you children. We went over a weekend in early August, 2010, two adults and two children (3 and 5).Never go in the sumnmer hols and especiallly never at a weekend. The park is mobbed. They let in 10 times more people than the park can handle. We went on 3 rides in 2 days!!! The queues were that bad.Be aware that there is absolutely nothing there for toddlers. The crucial height restrictions are 1.2m and 1.4m. There really is nothing there for toddlers, a couple of pathetic rides (teacups!)for those up to 1m, a couple more pretty pathetic things for those above 1.2m but to get on 90% of the rides you have to be over 1.40m. Consequently, a visit is pointless with children under 1.40m (ie below about 7 years old).It is expensive, but that's no surprise.The park is massive but there is very little in it. Expect to walk for miles for very little return. Actual rides and attractions probably take up less than 2% of the entire surface area of the park. Disney's plan has cklearly been to fit as many people as possible into the park without any concern that there is nothing for the crowds to do once inside.The queues are truly horrendous. Expect to queue for between 1   2 hours for every ride. I had read this before I went and had assumed that the queus would be for the big thrill rides bit no one would queue for the sorts of things my 3 and 5 year old would want to go on. I was very wrong. As there is nothing for the young, the teacups and the carousel, the sort of basic rides you would find at any town fair in the UK, had queues of up to 2 hours!!! With hot, bored, tired children the scenes were horrendous. I canlt believe people put themselves through this and that no one onTrip Advisor or anyone else points out these horrors out.We were satying at the Sante Fe Hotel, which was very basic (just an accomodation block), but functional enough. We had tickets for 3 days but only stayed for 2 days as the experience was so awful. You simply can't have fun in those crowds, that heat, that much walking and so much queing for so little. For example, we queued for 1 hour to go on the carpets over Agra ride, a grand name for a simple toddlers fairground ride. I timed the ride. It lasted 1 minute 20 seconds. We had qeued for an hour!Make sure you bring a pushchair, you will need it. You can rent shopping trolley like pushchairs at the park for 9 euros per day but make sure you keep a hold of your receipt because people will nick your pushchair when it's parked! If you have your receipt you can at least go back and complain and get given another one (we had our pushchair nicked twice in 2 days!)Re food and drink, it's all junk food and coke. It is not possible to buy milk anywhere inside, outside or within miles of the park! If you do find some, it will be UHT milk.Bizarrely enough, children make up about 5% of the vistors to the park! The vast majority of visitors are adults from across Europe and lots of couples in theire 20's and 30's. Whether they were simple before they arrived , I don't know, but once there they seem to forget the normal structure and behaviour of adults in society. They visit all the rides. Whilst standing in line for small, basic funfair rides like the teacups and a carousel, suitable for those up to 5, I was amazed that 80% of the queue was made up of adults without children or adults with teenagers... to go on toddlers rides!!!!!!!!! This bizarre behaviour is repeated across the park.But queing is the name of the game there. You queue for everything, for hours. Before the parades start, people start queuubng and sitting down about 1 hour before! The park is not designed to enable you to see anything. Imagine a nor mal falt street with a parade on it, unless you are kerbside, you see nothing.The fantilusion parade is quite nice to watch but it starts at 10.30pm, ideal for toddlers   NOT! it lasts 30 minutes, then there ios a load of faffinf around and then the fireworks start at about 11.10pm. The fireworks are lovely, but what child can stay awake until that time. Our children are always up late, but with the heat, drudgery and qeueuing they were fast asleep and had been begging to be taken home hours before..All in all, I would strongly advise that you don't go to DLP. It's all hype. The actual experieince is tortorous at worst and deeply disappointing at best. There is absolutely nothing there for children under 1.40m, even if there were no queues and the park was empty, there still wouldn't be anything for young children to do. The three toddlers rides they have are teacups, a carousel and one other standard fairground ride. However, Disney have placed these rides in hard landscaping, given them a fancy name and tried to build some hype sround what are in fact utterly bog standard funfair rides that you will see in aat any county town fair in the UK, and whihc you can ride for 2 quid without qeueing.My children were so excited about going but when we got there, they were the first to want to leave. We had tickets for 3 days but left after 2 days deeply disappointed. In fact mad, because we then went on to Burgundy for the rest of our 7 day holiday. It was amazing, the beuaty and interet of the unspoilt hsitoric environment was incredible and served only to remind us how we had wasted 2 days of our lives at DLP.All in all, if you are simple, and an adult and like queuing, you may enjoy yourself.If you want your children to have fun, then take them to funfair in the UK and spoil them for a couple of hours. They will have much more fun and you will save hundreds of pounds. But whatever you do, don't believe the hype about DLP, it's all garbage.

What a disappointment, firstly the place is so crowded, then it is full of food outlets and souvenir shops, if they concentrated as much on the rides and entertainment as they have on the shops it might be something worth visiting. Then there is the issue of height restrictions, if you are under 140cm you can't go on certain rides, but you still pay the same price as those who are 140cm and above. I fortunately bought our tickets from the train station which cost me 45 euro per person, which adds up to alot for a family of 5. Luckily we took food with us, but if we were to eat there, you could not get a decent meal for less than 10 euro per person, as it was on the way home we paid 6 euro for a crappy tasting hot dog in a squished roll.Worst thing of all is the long queues waiting for the rides, my kids waited 50 mins for a 2 mins ride, in all we were there from 11am till 8pm and between my three children they got to go on 6 rides.As for any other entertainment, there really isn't much and if you happen to see any characters in the streets, good luck even getting close, let along getting a photo with them.We are from Australia and if you have been to the theme parks at the Gold Coast you would know that disneyland does not even come close to the quality, value for money and entertainment.SERIOUSLY DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME, A DAY IN PARIS IS MORE WORTH IT",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

In fact, it's hard to find a place to stand where you do NOT smell smoke. It's vile.

From the DLP web site it appeared that this offered a great deal for lunch and dinner at table service restaurant and saved us concerns about the poor   :    exchange rate.When we got the vouchers at Ashford Station (we travelled via Eurostar) we found that only one meal per day was table service or buffet and the other was only counter service (i.e. burger, chips,cola and a yogurt).As such the package deal was not a saving and in fact I think it cost about 40% than paying for the meals directly. It is good for Disney as it guarantees the revenue stream.DLP are saying that the meal restrictions were clearly shown on their web site but they have been deleted now.

I simply couldn   t believe it.The room was dirty     there was rubbish in the ice bucket and the bathroom floor was dirty.The window catch on one window was broken and a metal arm was hanging loose.Reception did not answer the phone when we tried to ring down.There were tiny towels in bathroom and not enough for 4 people as an adult would need two. It was like staying in a really cheap 'motel'.The shows were adequate, but certainly not spectacular. The    Winter Wonderland    party in Frontierland seemed to be more about cutting costs during the off season by having very few cast involved than providing a good show. And the cast could not skate well!     it looked like something put on by an amateur group.We had a nice dinner with the characters in Disney Village and enjoyed the rides, but In general, while the parks themselves have good rides, the staff do not smile nor seem that they are interested in children. There were a couple of good staff and I hate complaining, but really this was not a    magical    experience. We did our absolute best to enjoy the holiday, but we   ve had far, far better.Overall, Disneyland Paris was an expensive holiday, a poor experience andwe will not be returning.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1764,62270822,1,missing,United Kingdom,"Just got back from a 3 night break with the family having taken our granddaughter for her fourth birthday. Lovely weather but that's about the only positive thing to report. We have been to Orlando several times and the original Disneyland in California but this one is a very poor offering in comparison. As other people have reported the parks are small and very crowded even at this time of year with waits of up to 100 minutes for some rides. Even the smaller rides were crazy. Having queued for an hour with a four year old for a three minute ride on the Dumbo roundabout you have to question the Disney 'magic'.However all this pales into insignificance when you consider (as many other reviewers have mentioned) the people. I have never been in such a rude, offensive ignorant crowd of people in my life   nor will again, given the choice. I won't stereotype and I am sure that there are some delightfully cultured, polite French people, but they certainly weren't in Disneyland Paris. We were shoved, jostled, barged out of the way as the locals pushed their way through. Not a word of apology   at best a hostile glare for having the temerity to be in their way. And not just the younger people. The charming disregard for any manners at all was embraced by all generations equally. The only apologies I heard in the parks were either in English or German  is there actually a word for 'sorry' or 'excuse me' in French? One has to wonder.And its not just the ignorant visitors that let the place down; the staff are a sorry bunch too. OK I accept that most of them are on minimum wages and probably have to work long hours but do they have to appear so miserable? Yes they were polite and many of them had considerable language skills but. with a few exceptions, there was no excitement or enthusiasm. They may just as well have been working in a supermarket. Those of you who have been to the American parks will know what I mean. There the 'cast' members really make an effort to embody and radiate the fun and excitement of the place and all of the ride crews interract with the visitors with a ready smile or some silly remarks or acting and it makes the whole experience something special. Here they don't bother   you're just a body to be moved onto or off of a ride like so many cattle. Great!We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which was OK. The rooms were American in style with two big beds and a decent bathroom and it was clean. Unfortunately the attention to detail was poor with light bulbs missing, air conditioning which didn't work and, in our room, a bottle of pop left by the previous occupants behind the curtains and missed by the cleaners which started to fizz at 3 in the morning. Not so good.We ate in the hotel buffet the first night which was great   if you like bland luke warm overpriced food and surly staff. The total bill was in excess of 150 Euros for 4 adults and a child which I felt was outrageous as could have eaten twice as well for half the price in any restaurant chain in the UK.So good points....not many.

Don't go if you can help it.All shops are the same, lovely beautiful buildings and houses but nothingness in side. If you like the same merchandise being thrown at you in every building that resembles a house, then fair enough. Why couldnt they have Mickey and Donald having tea or doing a stooges act of some kind? Just shops shops shops. Overpriced crystal Mickeys etc too much branding, not enough fun.Freezing weather in February (biting cold), which is natural, but yet only food on the stands were coke and popcorn...where's the hot food? Tea, coffee? Jacket potatoes? I was in awe of their lack of common sense, the person running it is lacking something in their head. Plenty of clothes shops open. Plenty of Mickeys charging money for photos. The magic disappears as quick as your euros do.Every restaurant is like walking into McDonalds... awful. Food tastes horrible and there is little choice but burgers and hotdogs. The rides are seriously out of date, I'm 31, but my last visit was when I was 14yrs old, it was exactly the same. There is an extra park, but it reminded me of an industrial estate. The space simulator ride broke down halfway (after 45 minutes waiting in the cold), we got a brief apology by confused staff and led out the back door. Probably just as well because it had been boring as hell up to that moment.Most of the staff looked bored out of their head and it was like being in a gypsy fairground. The restaurants are quite obviously not large enough to cope with the number of tickets they sell, as you have to reserve. Staff sit everywhere with their hand gestures telling you not to do this, not to do that, don't sit here, get off the road, stop here, really started getting on my nerves after 2 days.Repetitive parades with annoying music (after 4 days you'll feel like throwing your coke at Mickey Mouse). The rides will have you waiting for an hour, but will last 3 minutes. We had a couple of good moments, the Rock n Roller coaster was good, the Little Mermaid show my 2 yr old loved, and the Cars ride. Thats all I can muster with positivity about the place.

Please think twice before you make a decision to go here.Amongst everything else, if you are British now is a very bad time to be going over there, because of the    against the Euro. Once you get there, you are trapped. There is no local supermarket to stock up on soft drinks or snacks. There is nothing but Disney and it's merchandise for miles around. The whole thing is a very clever, expensive, well oiled machine. You HAVE to eat and drink there, and boy, do they nail you on prices. The food is ALL burgers, chips and pizza. Not bad for an odd day but any longer and feel like the man who made the film 'Supersize me'. Even the vile fast food is so disgusting. I was shocked as I thought the French even did fast food well. Not the case. For a simple cheeseburger, no drink or fries you are talking about   7. For 4 of you, even very little children who eat hardly anything, to eat in Rainforest Cafe, you are talking   80. Easily. My 2 year old has come home with 'French Belly'. It was dirty. You don't expect that in a Disney Resort anywhere. A nice reminder for the long trip home.  We stayed at the Hotel New York, not actually a bad hotel. But even their room service food was similar, with little choice. A tiny, burnt pizza here cost   20 to be delivered to your room. Because it is a Disney Hotel, British families, I am ashamed to say, were letting their kids run wild. They were screaming and running up and down the corridors at midnight and the same from 6.00 am. I felt like I was in Disney Hell.If you want to see the Disney Characters, which is what sets Disney about from other theme parks, you will have to get in line. And wait. It's as if they are rationed to the public, unlike the US versions (why??? Isn't this their USP?). Your kids will either have to queue up, for half an hour to meet them and have a picture taken, or you will have to fight with hundreds of French and Italian people, to get near them. It was awful. Grown adults were shoving little kids out of the way or trampling on them. I saw a British woman in tears with her baby in tears, and another British couple ending up in a row with a horrible Italian woman, who knocked their little girl for six. It was that bad. Not quite the magic I expected. My own daughter wept because she couldn't get near anyone. So disappointing.We were told to go mid week. Which honestly wasn't much better, than the Sunday when we arrived . If you like queuing for 45 mins per kiddie ride, be my guest. This is the place for you.Some of the areas needed a lick of paint. The staff around Disney, I have to say, were pretty nice. You'd expect that for 2 adults paying   70 per day. The French that are there, are in the main, so rude, queue jumping pushing and shoving their way to the front, it will make you wish you had stayed at home.We asked my 4 year old daughter what her favourite part of the trip was. She very innocently said,'swimming in the hotel pool with Daddy'. That tells you everything you need to know. I think that Disney in Florida would be a much better choice if you could afford it. But please, save yourself time and money and a lot of stress and don't bother with the Paris one.

You receive a card where you see the time you are welcome for breakfast. The choice of food is not great. The price of the hotel is hugh, compare it with more expensive 4 or 5 star hotels.

Waiting times were not so long, from 5 minutes to max 20 30 minutes for the big attractions. Attractions are good. On saturday however, the lines were horrible. Up to 120 minutes. Luckily for us, we visited all the attractions and ran away from the parc. It was so crowded, i couldn't believe my eyes. What annoyed me most was the French element. The staff was arrogant, uninterested and not friendly at all. What a difference when i compare this to Disney World Orlando. There all the staffmembers are happy, helpfull and with their behaviour they add that magic to the Disney experience. Too bad that in France, such high standards are impossible.

1779,50699437,2,missing,United States,"I am very disappointed that i have to write this complaint, but we were very unsatisfied with our stay at Santa Fe Hotel, Disneyland Paris from 6th November '09 to 8th Novemever '09. We went especially for our child's first birthday as we wanted it to be a special, magical day for him.  There were numerous issus that arose over our weekend at Disneyland Paris, and feel that these should be reported and followed up. As a customer and mother I do not agree how these issues could of occured on our visit and am disgusted that Disneyland Paris allow such rude and unfriendly attitudes towards their paying customers. Firstly, when we arrived we were given a room on the first floor of which there was no lift for us to take the pram up even though on our booking we had noted that we had a baby with us. We had to go back to reception and ask for a room on the ground floor. The next room we were given was right next to the main entrance into the building. The main entrance door to the block would not shut so a draft was coming underneath our door. We stopped the draft by putting towels down by the door. We had a baby in a cot which is close to the floor, having to put towels by the door to stop the draft is really not good enough. When initially checking in, we were asked a time we would like to have breakfast. We asked if we had to chose a time as with a baby we are never on time and didnt want to rush. We were told that we had to chose a time, so we did. The next morning we frantically rushed to get ready for our allocated breakfast time, only to find ourselves waiting in a long queue. At first we thought the queue was for our table and waited patiently. As we had to rush to make it down on time, our baby was still in his night clothes. We then realised the majority of people in the queue did not have their ticket with an allocated time on, and the Disneyland Staff were just letting them in for breakfast with no priority for the people queuing with a ticket. When we finally found a table we found it to be dirty, the milk machine was out of milk, there were only broken bits of bread in the bread basket and there were no glasses to get juice. This is unacceptable. We are trying to get our child used to a feeding time. We had to break our schedule to fit in with the Santa Fe rules, only to find out nobody was sticking to the rules anyway.All this time was wasted which we could have spent in the park. Our friends then went back to the room to get a shower while we finished eating and feeding our baby. On return to the room, they found the new key they were given didn't work, so they had to go back to reception to fix this problem. Once again, more time that was lost that could have been spent in the park. They had to queue for a considerable amount of time to get to the reception desk, only to then speak to an incredibly rude and ignorant manager. Our friends explained the problem about the key to him, and expressed that they were disappointed about loosing time in the park as they also had to queue for breakfast when other people were allowed to push in etc. The manager replied that there were problems at Santa Fe with regards to the breakfast, but they had tried numerous other ways of doing it and the way they were currently using worked best. He then went on to add that he had been to many other hotels throughout the world and that they all have problems. Our friends said that they were also frequent travellers and had not seen breakfast in such shambles as that! The manager went on to argue with our friends that he had been to more countries and and stayed in more hotels than they had!! We find this to be completely unprofessional. The manager tried to resolve the problem by promising that he would come back to the room and fix the key. He never did. The rest of our 2 day stay we had to share the key which was completely unreasonable.  When we finally got to the park we were having a lovely time until.. We had booked the 'Birthday Meet and Great' in the Lucky Nugget for our son's first birthday. Again, we wanted his day to be extra special and one to remember for all of us. I phoned twice and both times when I reseved a place I was asked for his age and name. Once again, we had to wait a considerable amount of time to even be let into the Lucky Nugget, in which time other guests had started gathering outside. When the doors eventually opened, we found the other guests to push in and bombard other guests. With regards to Health and Safety, this is a very dangerous situation.  When we arrived we were seated at a table and then we went to change our son's nappy. When we came back, the staff were handing out the birthday cakes. We found the waiters to be very rude. They literally plonked the cake down in front of us. Nobody said happy birthday to him. A card was also placed on the table which was blank. It didn't even his name writen on it.  Goofy, Pluto, Tigger and Tac came round to meet our son, of which he loved. Then we spotted Mickey, but he was going round every table so we thought he would come to us last as we were situated near the end. When Mickey finally got to the tables near us, we assumed he would then come to us. To our dismay we relised he was about to leave, so my partner went over to him and kindly asked if he could you come over to say happy birthday to our son and sign his card. Mickey's helper then very rudely and abruptly replied  no, we are going he has no more time . We were so incredibly disappointed and upset by this. Our son has a Disneyland Paris autograph book with pictures of him with everyone except Mickey. Later, the staff then brought around the surprise for the the birthday boy girl and missed our table, so I went to the bar and asked if our son could have his surprise. A staff member called Aissa then went to get one and gave it to our son. We quickly realised the surprise was not suitable for under 3's, so we asked them if he could have a different surprise suitable for his age group. Aissa then went to find another product and once again came back with another surprise that was not suitable for under 3's. Aissa told us they didn't have anything for under 3's which I found funny as we were in Disney which is aimed at children, and we had seen things suitable for his age group around the park. We found the lady we spoke to very abbupt and her attitude towards us appalling. I was concerned my son would pick up on her negative approach as they pick things up so quickly at his age. I informed her that we had paid for him to have a birthday cake, meet the characters and receive a birthday surprise and that he had not recieved his surprise. She rudely replied 'You didn't pay for him'. We had to pay 19 euros a head for the adults. What right does she have to talk to paying customer like that? She then tried to get around the situation by telling us the surprise was not included in the price, and then told us that he could have the surprise that was not suitable for under 3's for him. Items have warnings printed on them for a reason. If our son had choked on the gift that Disneyland Paris gave him that was not suitable for his age group, imagine the public interest and what would be printed in the newspapers. Luckily we did notice, but if Disneyland Paris is going around giving presents to other children and the parents are not so alert to this, it's an accident waiting to happen. I told her that I would like to speak to a manager about these issues, only to be told there were no mangers on site. Once again, if something was to happen in the Lucky Nugget and there was no manager around to handle the situation, imagine the interest of the public and newspapers. Something else waiting to happen really!Finally a supervisor came and spoke to us. He was very pleasant and understanding of our issues raised to him. He also told us that we could complain near the entance of the park and explained that he could not do much more than which we found to be resonable. So, why couldn't Aissa who gave him the unsuitable toy, or the manager at Santa Fe handled it the same? Why did they have an abusive, threatening and uncaring attitude towards us? We're paying customers, wanting a fantastic birthday for our son. We found the staff to be unreasonable with us and make our time at Disneyland Paris uncomfortable and stressful. So much time was wasted going back and forth which could have been spent in the park. We're disgusted that Disneyland Paris employ people with such poor customer service and unacceptable approach to customers to work around children and deal with children and families everyday on their special occasions. The time for his birthday party was runined and we payed 19euros a head *4 to be argueing a fair point with a staff member that was so unreasonable and rude which i feel is totaly wrong. We paid   636 for 2 nights in a draughty room which was not suitable for a child to sleep in a cot low to the floor. When we complained at City Hall the staff were very helpful, understanding and friendly. They totaly understood our point that we could not give this toy to our son and kindly gave him teddy which was very kind. Why couldn't that have been done earlier at the Lucky Nugget? They were also very sympathetic about our troubles at Santa Fe. They informed us to write to Disneyland Paris as this is not acceptable behaviour for staff at Disney. We are so angry and upset to think we paid all that money for our son's birthday and ended up treated in such a poor manner. Disneyland Paris is meant to be a family park and we didn't expect such low standards, rudeness and aggressiveness.  So, that was his first birthday. It was meant to be incredibly special. Instead, it was an incredible let down.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Now that   s out of the way the truth of the matter is it is the biggest child manipulation for the purpose of adult extortion I have ever seen     The whole setup is geared to getting children to have a major I want fit at every corner throwing in the fact that a captive audience has no choice but pay through the nose,The good parts are few and far between but let me try to highlight them.1     That done now the bad points     food which is a no choice requirement will cost you   6 for a hot dog with tinned sausage or there is the toffee apples at   3 then there is a portion of chips at   3 which is half a Mc Donald   s portion ice creams come out at   3 for the smallest and a cup of coffee is   2.50 per dribble. We had one meal in the park which was a mixed grill consisting of a sausage, one 3 inch rib, a small burger and chips x 4 and 2 child meals of nuggets and chips with coffees and juices which came to   76.But you go for the spectacle and except the prices you say     Well to start it was raining so the travelators from the car park to Disneyland were not working so a walk of half a mile is you first jaunt followed by another 3 miles walking around getting fast passes to get on the rides followed by another 3 miles going on the rides and finding the fast passes are not so fast so you miss most of the rides you had fast passes for as you end up queuing anyway.Getting pictures of your nearest and dearest with Mickey or Pluto and the gang is a mad fight for the queue only to be the ones that just misses as Mickey had to go for a show and as we seen needed a fag break     Then there is the French element to the problem as they seem to think that queuing is a British requirement and they have a god given right to push in which caused at least 5 near punch ups with parents that I saw.     Be aware that if you are over 6 feet tall and stocky they will let you queue for 2 hours only to tell you you are to big for the ride when you get to the front and this is most prevalent on the Nemo ride.     We got a fast pass for Indiana Jones train at 2pm which got us in at 8pm just to give you an idea on how bad it is.There is an American grill just outside the gates called Annett   s Diner where we stopped to get some chips, you can see the cooking staff while you wait which caused us to cancel our order as they were handling raw chicken and cooked food without washing their hands as well as the normal itch scratching problems they seem to have and it looked like a scene from the Somali refugee cook houseBe sure as eggs are eggs the grandchildren will love it to bits and you will get some memorable photos but in the end as long as we accept this total rip off we deserve to be exploited by this money grabbing company that is so far removed from the great Walt Disney as to be unrecognisable.We spoke to an American working at the park that was on an exchange and she said it was terrible and nothing like the Florida Disney and she told us she would complain when she got back to the states.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

The rides were good, the kids loved Buzz Lightyear. We took some snacks with us, which saved some money. We ate at Cafe Mickey, the food is discusting! lots of characters which was the only good thing. Rainforest cafe was better and the Lucky nugget saloon was ok but nothing great. Bad service in this one, waited 20mins to pay. They rush you then your left standing and waiting for ages. Buffalo Bills is worth it! Was great, we really got involved and was fun! The people are pushy and rude, pushing my 5 year old. I'd had enough after 2 days! Was a good time but we wouldnt go back there again!Everything expensive, but i knew what to expect. We travelled on eurostar which is great, Disney Express works very well too. The longest queue was about 30mins for Nemo and Peter Pan. but usually the queus go quite quick and we were usually only waiting for 5 10 mins. I wouldnt recommend going on a Saturday, it got extremely busy on this day. When it rains it rains! Head for the studios for more shelter! Stitch Live was worth seeing too. Be very careful, when its wet everywhere is very slippery, lots of people falling over! No one queues for anything, so in the end we stopped queueing too. They shove you in the lines, i ended up barging them back just to make them stop. Even with me being pregnant they do not care! Take rainjackets you WILL need them! If travelling on Eurostar you can take as much luggage as you want. We bought back lots of presents even a huge globe in a box and it was fine. there is an Esso garage outside near the Santa Fe but we didnt go there. The shuttle buses were fine for us, no pushing.

We managed to get on a few of the smaller rides and decided to brave the queues the following day. I have to say and I may be generalising but the French really don't seem to like Brits, it was quite apparent from both the french public and the staff especially at the hotel. Having been to Florida I have to question the positioning of this park as they didn't seem to have the same hospitality skills to deliver the  Disney Magic !!!!! Also no one seemed to know how to wait in line it was definatley evryone for themselves. I was surprised at how small the park was and the tour in the studios was poor. If I had to sum up the park and hotel I would say if is a very poor relation to Disney in the USA. One last comment, everyone seemed to be smoking in all areas and as it was so busy it felt very claustrophic and ash was flying everywhere and I was worried about me daughter who was in the pushchair!!!

There was no attempt by the 'minders' to stop this and resulted in many tears from the younger ones. The characters themselves made no attempt either to calm the situation and simply walked away after a few minutes leaving some very upset children and parents!We have been going to Disney both in Paris and Florida for many years and whilst I have never seen such disorganisation in Florida it has been more apparent in Paris on our last couple of visits. I feel it is such a shame that this is being allowed to happen as this is one of the main things children want to do, meet their favourite characters, but if it is going to be marred by scenes such as we saw then Disney need to address this and sooner rather than later.

No we don   t have any fast pass here; you have to get them at the entrance. Well they asked us to go here. She made a phone call. Well we don   t    have any at the moment try and come back to the entrance in a few hours. I asked if she would call me on my cell phone when they had them, and the answer was    no   .

The staff there didn   t believe us     of course there is fast passes at the entrance     he refused to help and kind of laughed at us! Thanks a lot!We then went to the entrance again and now they had fast pass tickets, so we went around to the different attractions to get a time, the mountain train we got tickets for 11:20 pm     and that part of the park closes at 10pm that evening     we contacted staff and explained that we had waited several hours for fast passes, and now we had had a ticket for 11:20 pm     1 hour 20 minutes after they close.

Finally he gave up, wrote a little note and asked us to give this to the waiter. Then we entered the restaurant hardly any guests at least 2 3 the tables were empty.

MGM Studios is tiny, and the two main rides are only Terror Tower and Aerosmith ride. And that is basically it there. The other park is much bigger, but the rides are all for younger children.Saying that, the cost of getting into the park and food in there is a joke  you're looking at 20 euros each for just a burger and chips. 2.50 euros for any bottle of drink so take your own.Downtown disney it not too bad; again the cost is scaled way too high.We were both very disappointed when we went, and would not recommend going for younger people.

My family, which included my brother, his wife and their 8month old daughter, myself and my 2 1 2 year old son arrived to the Disneyland Hotel (a four star rated hotel on the website) and we were perplexed as to where the valet service was. Directions for cars were not mark however when we figured out where to go we were pleasantly greeted by hotel staff both at the valet station and at reception. We allowed for the bell service to take our bags and were assured by the receptionist that our bags would be up to our room shortly. As we walked through the hotel filled with and overpowering scent of powder fresh, we made our way to the elevator that took us to the first floor which our room was located. The decor was beautiful, however upon inspection of the room, mold was noted to be in the corners of the bathtub, no refrigerator was available for people with infants who needed formula or stored breast milk. The  family room  that we booked, was supposed to be slightly larger and more suitable for, well, families was the same size as a regular room with two full size bed in a small room. Our baggage was missing for an hour before we finally called the front desk and reach someone who said they would bring our bags up. At that time we finally received our bags. We then made our way to dinner...this is when we noted a disclaimer. Dinner reservations are simply a requirement at the restaurants for dinner. The buffet at Inventions was mediocre. I've honestly had better at the Hilton in Austin, TX. We sat down to dinner and were excited to see Goofy who seemed to be making his way around each table. As he began to approach our table he turned his back towards the children and began to walk off to the restaurant kitchen leaving our children in the wind with no picture, autograph, not even a pat on the head. We began to get passed up by several of the characters through the night and we not only got heartbroken for the children, but frustrated as well. We asked the waiters if the characters appeared for breakfast in the same restaurant, as the website said you would enjoy your breakfasts every morning with Disney characters, the waiter said only two characters would be outside the restaurant for a certain amount of time. The price was not worth the food nor the experience. I paid 230 Euro dollars for 3 adults and 1 child to have a buffet dinner that you could get for 16 Dollars total on the Las Vegas strip. I really just wanted to make everyone eat until completely stuffed so we would get our money's worth.Breakfast in the morning was better than dinner. Although only one character would stand in front of the fireplace mantle at a time lines were formed so that people wouldn't get pushed back. The parks themselves are not comparable in size nor attractions to those of the parks in the US. We started our adventure on a rainy day and as such no Disney characters were in sight. We were given FastPass tickets that we could use for only one ride and were invalid at peak hours (from 1300 1600). Some workers looked as though they hated their job and treated guests at the park as though they hated their jobs. When my brother and I went to use our FastPass at 1610, the lady at the line said the tickets could not be used because it was past 1600. We were confused and mad. Walt Disney Studios was very small and this is actually were the children met the most characters. It only took approximately 3 4hours to walk around the park, see the attractions, and go on the rides that were worth going on. For lunch, we decided to make our way to Planet Hollywood since we needed some decent American food...yeah, that was not at all what we got. The spinach dip was disgustingly tasteless, the alfredo sauce had no taste or salt in it at all, the penne whatever my sister in law got was so awful she spit out her first bite and pawned it off on my poor brother. My fajitas were edible until I put quacamole on it. The quacamole tasted rotten. And the service...not only was our waiter rude to us in a sense that he always seemed like he had better things to do when he took our order he also failed to bring us water that we requested 3 times and almost forgot about the babies' food.Overall, my family and I were not impressed with the hotel, the parks, the staff, or the restaurants.

The second time (three years ago) there was a strike on so no parades and hardly any characters. Disneyland Studios at the time was sad and gave the impression that it was closing down and the food was terrible. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which, at the time, was actually very nice. Strange how things can change in three years. We returned in April this year due to a massive family get together (so Disney would not have been my choice). What a huge disappointment. Lets start with the Sequoia were we stayed. Clean, but poor service throughout. The bath towels were the size of hand towels, one soap between the three of us sharing the room for the duration, the plug in the sink didn't work (i.e. you had to use a nail file to prise it out) and only half the lights in the room worked. I have since found out from friends associates who have also stayed at the Sequoia that they all experienced this as well      we can   t have all stayed in the same room!The main park at Disney, shows signs of being run down. The trams seem to have disappeared, as have the old cars. The toilets were dirty and the parades were, how can I put this, pathetic. If you want to see a decent parade go to Bridgwater Carnival in Somerset!The Studios fared slightly better in as much as it looks like it   s had a lick of paint, since our last visit. However, again, it is almost as if they are trying to save money big time. This was particularly obvious in Honey I shrunk the Kids. It was so worn that the film was fuzzy and half the audience couldn   t feel the mice. We had to explain to those of our party that had never been before what was supposed to happen.

Firstly it was like a rugby scrum of a morning (mostly with the other french guests) who dont queue like the english! just to get your hands on something to eat   and then there's a terrible 'continental' selection. Only croissants, 3 types of very sweet cereal, and cheese and ham to make up sandwich rolls from! Rubbish coffee, no Tea so all that was left that was ok, was orange or pineapple juice.

To eat or drink, you probably need your grandmother's inheritance. If you are going for your little ones be aware that most of the more interesting attractions they won't be able to go on due to their height. The ones you can go on, you will likely queue for an hour and be disappointed. Bolshy crowds, extautionate prices and a great deal of walking is what is in store for you. The highlights as we experienced them were the parade at 4.15 pm where you actually get to see most of the princesses (otherwise you only get a quick view or take on the angry crowd for a photo or autograph) and the star wars attraction. Again for the star wars you need to be ready to queue in a hot tunnel for long periods of time. For boys over the age of 7 yet too short for the roller coasters this is the only attraction you can enjoy.

1800,30800695,1,missing,United Kingdom,"Me, My wife and my 14month old son went to Disney and Paris for 4 days over the late May Bank Holiday weekend. We spent time at both parks (Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney Studios). Given that our son is still young, we thought that this would be a perfect opportunity for all of us to have a good time in that we could do kiddie stuff whilst he was up and go on the adult rides whilst he had his naps. Here is our experience.    Baby Unfriendly   this park is not particularly baby friendly. Note that pushchairs are not allowed in any queues for rides or attractions and nor are they allowed inside for any of the shows. What this means is that if your baby is sleeping in his pushchair (and you don   t want to wake him up), you are stuck since you can   t join any queues. Disney have a clever concept called    Baby switch    whereby if you are parents with a baby it allows you to queue up and then take it in turns to go on the ride (with the other person looking after the baby). Nice idea if executed properly. What these buffoons at Disneyland Paris do is only allow one parent to queue whilst the other parent (with the baby) waits at the exit. Once the first parent has been on the ride (after queuing for say 1 2 hours on their own), then the other parent can go on the ride without queuing. Whichever genius thought of this didn   t realize that maybe if parents are on a    family    day out holiday, they probably don   t want to stay apart for the bulk of this period. Note: even if the baby is awake, you are not allowed to carry him in the queue.    Thrill Rides   As an adult, there is one decent ride that you could call a    thrill ride    and that is the Rock   N   Rollercoaster in Walt Disney Studios (which is excellent). The remainder of the rides were absolutely rubbish and I can say that none of them come even close to Nemesis, Air or Oblivion at Alton Towers. If you are an adrenalin junky     this is not the place.    Disney Characters     There is very little of the Disney    Magic    here     you can walk around for hours without seeing a single character, and the characters are mainly scheduled to be in certain places at certain times (e.g. parades). Would it be too difficult to have characters constantly walking around in the park     we are in Disneyland for gods    sake     I don   t think having characters actually around will demean the brand!    Staff     With few exceptions, the staff were rude and unhelpful. I asked a popcorn vendor for the location of the    Pirates of the Caribbean    ride (which is a big attraction and was actually about a 100 yards from where he was standing)     he just stared at me and said he didn   t know. We asked members of staff for the times of the English version of the Disney Play House show. After being fobbed off all day, at 5.30pm we were told that there were no shows that day in English due to technical reasons.    Although we were fortunate, we did bump into other people who said that they had been on 2 3 rides which had suffered from technical problems.    Smoking     they need to make this park a no smoking zone     it is pathetic to see smoke bellowing out everywhere, especially with children around.    Cleanliness     toilets were dirty, cutlery was not cleaned properly, generally untidy.    Queues     It is amazing how many people would jump queues (I am talking about teenagers   .and their parents!!)     try that in England and there will be fights!!Overall you don   t really get the feeling on any    Magic    here     the place is dirty, with unhelpful and unfriendly staff and is grossly overpriced. Although some of the shows are very good (e.g. the stunts show in Walt Disney Studios), overall it is not much of an experience. Maybe France isn   t the country that embodies the Disney culture and hence was always doomed to fail.I could go on   but I wont. My advice would be to go to Alton Towers, Gullivers Kingdom or Legoland in the UK (depending on what it is that you are after) and give this pathetic excuse of a Disney park a miss   OR save up for the real Disneyland which I have been informed by my wife is actually amazing.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

We stayed at the New York Hotel, which was great, couple of minor issues but would recommend the hotel overall. Those of us in the group who had been to Disneyworld in Orlando were disappointed with Disneyland Paris, the park just lacked the  Disney Charm  you get in Orlando. The worst thing was the smoking, there are designated smoking areas and supposedly a 68 euro fine for smoking outside of these but people are smoking everywhere regardless and with 2 small children and a pregnant member of the group it was quite unpleasant. The parks are not as clean and have to say the toilets were just disgusting. The staff varied some were just plain rude and unhelpful whilst others went out of their way to make sure the children were not stampeded by 40 year old woman who wanted their picture taken with a character first. The one thing we all hated was the total lack of manners displayed by a great number of visitors in the park. Europeans do not have the same level of manners as those in the USA and although it is not the fault of Disney there are things which could be done to improve matters.At the moment the exchange rate of GBP to Euro is very poor but the prices are crazy. To save money make up sandwiches from the breakfast buffet and take them in. They have a bag check at the front gate of the park but if you carry them wrapped in a jacket cardi they dont check and away you go. Disney Village has a good choice of places to eat but it is expensive. We ate in Planet Hollywood which was good quality and would say reasonable value for money. Annette's Diner was enjoyable but 4.80 for a pint of sprite with half a glass of ice spoiled it. Macdonalds is more expensive than home but still half the price of other places. It was however filthy and you were hit with a very unpleasant smell as you walked in the door. If you have been to Orlando dont expect the same at Disneyland Paris or you will be disappointed.

We booked a day's ticket for the three of us   myself and my two children for   118   ouch. On the basis of the cost alone one would have expected something fairly special.With our 'home printed' tickets we arrived at around 10am opening time on the Tuesday following Easter. The admittance procedure was chaotic and stressful with massive surging crowds around the turnstiles with very little guidance, charm or direction from the Dsiney staff. When we finally were pushed and shoved to the front of the queue, the girl on the barier managing to swipe one of the tickets twice which meant that we had to submit to an exhaustive security check as they suggested that I was presenting forged tickets!Having cleared that up, we managed to get straight onto Space Mountain with a mximum 20 minute queue and that certainly lived up to its name. An awesome Roller Coaster in the dark that totally terrified but delighted the kids!Things from that point went downhill. What my 'cheap' deal for the days ticket didn't tell me was that it excluded Fast Pass so you couldn't apply for an alloted time with Fast Pass Scheme to go on one of the more popular rides   hence saving time and minimising the queueing. The queues were on average 50 mins with everyone obediently shuffling around the little taped off sections for their 5 minute experience that rarely lived up to the hype. We spent more time in queues than we did 'having fun'. There appeared to be total indiffernce from Disneyland 'Cast Members' about the lenght of the queues or any attempt to entertain people whilst they were waiting   merely a bored gallic shrug.There were also very few Disney character is evidence. Part of the fun for the kids was to collect as many autographs as you can   brilliant if any of the characters were in evidence. We scored Wendy and Peter Pan plus a couple of Chipmunks and that was it. Not sure where the rest went, perhaps they were in hiding as I hear Mickey gets routinely mobbed everytime he puts in an appearance.Lunch though was the total joke. The kids were on for Pizza so we headed for the Bella Notte; looked and sounded promising. The system for ordering food was so chaotic that I stood in line for almost an hour before being served with microwaved lasagne, limp Pizza and a salad that was a long way past its best. The cost   40 for food that your local suprmarket would be too proud to sell you.The day was partially salvaged by an impressive Parade and a the ride (again after a marathon queue) on the Tower of Terror next door in Disny Studios. Asdie from the last hour, I wished we'd stayed in Paris and saved our money. The kids were underwhelmed too which somehow defeated the whole object.I hate to be so critical however we did go to Eurodisney about 8 years ago when the kids were younger and had a wonderful time so had high expectations. To say we were disappointed was an understatement. Its interesting that having booked online that many leisure companies are concerned about hearing feedback but not Disney.

A truly appalling experience and one that will see your wallet empty.We went yesterday at the insistence of our 3 kids. We are living in Paris so understand all about Paris prices. First off the cost: huge and you get little for it. Add in train fares from Paris a fast food lunch and the cost all up with admission for a family of 5 was about 460 euros or about US$630. For this you could fly from Paris to Dublin and back with the family for a whole weekend. Now this huge cost might not be so bad if you actually got something for your money. The queues are massive. The electronic signs at each ride showed lines of anything from 60 minutes to 120 minutes  for a 90 second ride. There is a 'Fastpass' system where you go to the ride and register for it later that day but the time lag between registering and riding was yesterday about 5 hours and you can only register for 2 rides. End result: you are wandering around the crowds getting frustrated and wondering why you are there. Ask yourself: do you have the stomach for a queue like this, running into hours with children in tow? Or even without them.Despite best efforts of our teenagers (who like all their generation seem to know how to work the system) my kids got on only 3 rides between arriving at 11:30am and leaving at 6:30pm. We visited in early Spring on a Saturday and out of European school holidays. The mind boggles as to what it would be like in Summer at peak time.How do you fill in the rest of your time? Well there are plenty of shops selling Disney themed things (did you come to ride or buy?) and places with long queues for fast food  a gastronomic crime in a country like France.So in summary: it's overpriced by a huge margin, particularly when you consider the many magnificent attractions Paris itself has to offer; you don't get what you paid for. At 60 Euros admission per person and 3 rides per person that's 20 Euros a ride. If there were modest queues (2 hours is not acceptable!) then you might feel you had received something for your money, but that is not the case by a huge margin.So my recommendation?

Come to find out (after waiting in long queues all day) that both parks closed early during the week and when we realized this it was already almost closing time for the other park, Walt Disney Studios park.

We found the same to be true on the Peter Pan ride as well. Hotter than heck inside the whole ride and a cool blast of air as we got off where all the employees were standing.

When their online reservation service sent us the wrong tickets (for those of you who have purchased online, you know that this is a process nearly impossible to mess up   there are several stages and repeated validations before the purchase can be made), they refused to exchange them for another date, despite (a) there being no difference in price, and (b) it being THEIR mistake.

I was assured, repeatedly, that this was not necessary. Foolishly, it seems now, I accepted these assurances, only to be told by three levels of park officials once I turned up at the Park that there was no way they could let us in. To be standing at a park gate, with two valid tickets, both paid for by me, and to have been ensured by representatives that entry was not a problem, only to be told that my only way into the park was to buy a new, full price ticket for my companion, was appalling. As a corporation, and on the level of individual service, Disney acted callously and perhaps dishonestly.

(why would you eat chicken thats been mass cooked, in the dark???)coffe cups were offered in replace for the glasses which I declined and again asked for a re fill. He went and returned with the words.....  NO MORE  and carried on to clear all the glasses away..

We had to wait in really long lines to see them both. I even asked at our hotel  The Disneyland Hotel  and they could not tell me where to find them. They just shook their head saying they have no idea what characters will be where. I could not believe my ears. Were we really at  Disney ???? I had to tell my kids that the princess were on a little vacation this week. It was heart breaking, truely. There was a castle and a whole  Princess Stage  area next to the castle, but no performances. I just could not believe it. I am sure my girls were not the only ones disappointed. Our weather was perfect during our entire stay which I think made the park even more busy than usual. The lines were unreasonably long for my two kids and so was the garbage everywhere. They bathrooms were even worse. I could not believe how many garbage cans were overflowing with garbage. And the bathrooms were so dirty and smelly I completely walked out of one and ran back to our hotel room just to use the toilet. I had a friend that visited in early March during a time the weather wasn't so nice and it was still very crowded and she also said the same thing that the garbage cans were overflowing every where and the bathrooms were just horrible.As for our hotel  The Disneyland Hotel, my husband and I were disappointed in the quality of the hotel. Yes, the location was perfect! The pool was not that great for young kids who are learning how to swim. Our room was really in need of updating ie...the bathroom, capet, linens. Personally we stayed at the Holiday Inn outside the park one night, and I thought it was nicer due to the updated bathroom etc... It was just newer all around.

Drive down from Calais not bad   this was our fourth visit. Checked in quickly at Hotel but disappointed to find no kettle in room and very surly cleaners on arrival at our room door. A great Disney welcome (not!). Unfortunately it was English half term and French school holidays and the park was very busy. Weather was attrocious and we had nowhere to get wet clothes dry easily. Queues to see the characters were long, we gave up half the time. Food was ridiculously expensive. We went to Planet Hollywood for Valentines Lunch and the in house photographer would not take no for an answer until I exploded. Went for coffee, and deli sandwiches one night cost 20 euros. Gave up after that and went to McDonalds. We found the French were given preferential treatment for everything. Queues everywhere all the time through security, for meals, characters. Having said that the new Buzz ride is great and the Stunt Show remains a favourite.However we will not return. Journey back home took 1 hour longer due to accident just on Paris outskirts.

We have been to all 3 parks and Paris is certainly the  poor relation . Magic Kingdom was ok , but dont forget to take food and drink with you   how families cope i really dont know. Much too expensive. Although it was february and no school hols it was busy. Some attractions were not opened due to the weather. Highlight was Space Mountain and low light was deffinately the price and quality of food. I must say Disney has managed to improve customer care with all french staff attempting to speak english and smile   certainly better than a few years ago where we were treated apaulingly by staff who refused to try and understand us because our french was poor. The second day we went to Disney studios   WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY ! The park was very small and attractions limited. The weather didnt help !!! We managed to get onto Aerosmith rollercoaster twice and to see the car show   thank goodness because we didnt find much else   ok Armagedon was ok but not really that special. There were technical problems with some rides that meant alot of people were just wandering around   and when we left after just 3 hours in the park we certainly weren't alone !!!!! People were leaving to go to Magic Kingdom or like us to go to find something to eat. We went to Disney Village and managed to be charged 20 euros for 2 sandwiches and coffee !!!!!

The food and merchandise is horrifically priced and for the food, of poor quality & a healthy option is nowhere to be seen.

Be warned if you have a campervan   it is TWENTY euros to park! We saw plenty of people turning around to find somewhere else. Surely if you are paying 43 euros per person (for one park) to get in, you shouldn't be expected to pay for parking.Despite this, the park was impressive and generally clean and well organised although it was phenomenally busy and hot with the French workmanship evident (potholes and cracks in the roads).Queues were already over an hour for the big rides by 12 o'clock, so we decided to use the fastpass system to allow us quicker access later. Generally this seems a good idea but be aware: this only seems to be operating up to about 1 o'clock   after this you will have a long wait (as we found with 70 minutes for thunder mountain).The rides were genuinely good, food ok although overpriced (but where isn't in a theme park) and the atmosphere was organised chaos. We didn't see any characters though and the parade was a madhouse.In general it was worth going, but to be honest I much preferred Florida Disney   it has the same rides but a far better atmosphere and is better value for money.

It was overcrowded and HOT   no airconditioning working made us feel hot and irratable. There was no small children activities like a play area but they do say that thre is in the hotel. When we asked where the area was they said just sit in the bar and gave us 4 crayons.?? There was only one 4 person passener lift to the dining area and around 100 people in a queue waiting to use the lift. The food was very expensive nothing really below 20euros for anything near decent. The europeans are rude   very rude men especially. The staff or crew there were mostly rude and not customer focussed. We booked our stay as a family over 6 months ago buton ceck in our rooms were floors apart. After creating a scene by them telling us they were fully booked they found 2 rooms ajoining miraculousley out of thin air as we had booked.

I am sure the sight of Mickey stopping your family eating will aruse the french around you and thus helping you avoid the hot dogs for 4,7 Euros3 Try helping us in saying to Disneyland Paris that they should do as at the Eiffel tower does and that is to candidly state the waiting time to see the top before you pay as it is important to give children the right expectations!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

Orlando is pretty much the same but much, much bigger with all the added attractions, EPCOT, water parks, etc. and those in themselves are really separate parks. Then there is Euro Disneyland just outside of Paris, about a 35 45 minute Metro ride. What a huge disappointment it was!

A typical example was the Alice in Wonderland maze.

Firstly, dont go to Disneyland Paris expecting everything to be in English because is ISN'T! It is 99% in french! Most attractions require you to wear earphones to hear the translation or have small tv screens dotted around with english subtitles. I thought this was a real downer to the trip. Disney should be in English not french, and as time passes it gets very irritating straining to listen or see the translations. For those of you who have been to Florida, you'll be in for a shock. Dont expect a similarity between the two. If Disney in Florida is ranked at say 100 then Disney paris may just reach a 3, its that much different and less than 1 100th of the size.Also, you'll find many of the staff at disney very reluctant to offer a good service and even more reluctant to speak engish. Basically dont expect an easy ride. The whole time I was there, it just didn't feel like Disney at all.

The amount of idiots with pushchairs (and double pushchairs) made matters worse. The resulting crush was unbeleivable and the show wasn't worth the hassle.If you're staying in one of the Disney hotels your bus ride to and fro is fine as there are plenty of the yellow Disney buses laid on. If you're in one of the four outlying hotels be prepared for mass hysteria as everyone in the four hotels tries to cram on to one of only two purple PEP buses that serve them.

1862,2968782,2,missing,Netherlands,"We visited Disneyland Paris with our kids in October 2001, and more recently in August 2004. The first time we went (in 2001), we stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne which was nice due to its location and fun wild west theme. However, it was a VERY pricey trip in all considering it was supposedly the low season (kids were NOT free) and many of the main attraction were closed for repairs (Pirates, It's a Small World, Carrosel, etc). Our family has grown since then (we have 4 children now under the age of 10) and this time there were no Disney hotels that could accomodate a family of 6 except for Davy Crockett's Ranch. This didn't work for us, 'cause you need to have your own transportation to and from the park; we flew into Paris from Amsterdam so we obviously didn't have a car. (How stupid is that, by the way   no shuttle service to DLP from one of the official DLP hotels!! That is something that maybe Europeans tolerate, but Americans never would!)So this time anyhow, we were able to get an awesome deal at the Holiday Inn at Disneyland Paris for two adjoining rooms (a great hotel, by the way  I would highly recommend it!) with a regular shuttle service. BUT   once you get INTO the park and surroundings, you quickly realize that this is anything but a charity ward. Having grown up on the West Coast of the US with regular vacations to The Magic Kingdom of Disneyland, I wasn't prepared for the highway robbery prices on everything at DLP! We just about went broke on meals in the three short days we were there   there was absolutely nothing there for families on a budget. On the last day we went to Mc Donalds in Disney Village to try to save a few bucks, but they were so crowded and expensive as well.The park was beautiful, but as a reviewer noted earlier, it just doesn't have the  heart  of the American parks (I noticed this also years ago when we were in Disneyland Tokyo) and somehow it lacks the  Disney Magic . The DLP park is definitely smaller than its American counterparts, and missing some important elements with regards to attractions. The fact that you are always reaching for your wallet (you are really at their mercy when it comes to food and drink there) really puts a damper on the happy, vacation feeling!A WORD OF WARNING: Do not go on Indiana Jones   Backwards!! unless you are suicidal!! In 2001, I went on the ride, and halfway through the trip when you go upside down backwards, I felt and heard an enormous C R A A A C K in my back! I got off the ride and could not even walk! I developed a hernia then and there from going on that ride, and have had problems with my back ever since!! And I am an avid roller coaster fan!!Another tip: Do not go to DLP during the peak summer months   you will be sorry! It was even more  crowded than Disneyland  (as we say in the States) and on the last day in the park, it took us 5 hours to go on just 3 rides (and we even had FASTPASSes!!)All in all, it was just a  nice  vacation, but not fantastic. This summer (2005) we are traveling to the US to be a part of the 50th Birthday Celebration at Disneyland, California with a commemorative special cruise on the Disney Magic, so I'll let you know how that is! Let's put it this way, it can't be worse than our experiences at DLP!!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1863,2967066,2,missing,United Kingdom,"I have been fortunate enough to go to Disneyland in Orlando in October this year and Disneyland Paris at Christmas. It cost me two thousand pounds for 2 nights at the Newport Bay travelling by Eurostar. I do have six kids but we fit into two rooms. It was not worth it.The journey on Eurostar was great. We boarded at Ashford and everything was very smooth. Tip: Park on Level 5 at Ashford   save queueing for the lift with your bags.The main park is almost the same as in Orlando but they don't have Mickey's Toon Town. The rides are, if anything, a bit better than in Orlando. But as has been said before the staff are only adequate. In America you do get a sense of the staff are happy in their work, in France it seems its just a job, like any any other service industry job, to them. This makes a huge difference to us on the receiving end. The park is showing its age now. The walkways are full of cracks and potholes forming puddles when it rains. You would never see any Orlando park in such a state of disrepair. Like the attitude of the staff, it is as if the company doesn't care. They are happy to settle for adequate when it should be perfect.The new park I liked a lot. It is small, you can do it all in a day, and less crowded than the main park when I was there. The car show is a must see.The disapointments for us came in the Disney Village and particularly the hotel. The food was only average and, compared with American prices, expensive. The hotel was again adequate. It too shows signs of age. Look closely and you'll see bits that are falling apart, stains not removed. Nothing to spoil your trip but when you have the memory of Orlando's standards fresh in your mind you feel let down by Disney. Worst of all: there is a little land train that runs from the village to the hotel. I got on it with 4 of my kids to save the 5 minute walk. They wanted 10 Euros to ride on it!   7.20 to save a 5 minute walk   in Disneyland!! Have they lost the plot completely! Anyone who has been to Orlando will know that paying for transport once you are in the resort is just unheard of.My advice: save up and go to Florida.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1864,2801260,2,missing,United Kingdom,"We've just come back from a couple of days at Eurodisney. I agree with a previous review writer that to the staff at Eurodisney its just a job, whereas at Orlando they do the job because they actually like to do it. That's not belittling all the staff at Paris as some where very helpful, albeit they seemed in the minority.We weren't warned that some of the rides were closed and the fast path tickets ran out early afternoon. Additionally we couldn't get a Park Guide in English as they had all ran out! We booked our tickets over the internet direct with Disney which failed to arrive and we waited 40 minutes to be given replacements on the day. Having been to Disney at Florida early this year perhaps gave us an unfair comparison.Whilst writing   does anyone know what the Halloween song was that was played?We didn't feel that the Park had the same Disney feel as Florida, true it was Halloween there but you could have been anywhere. There were very few characters going around.Having said all that   of course we will go again!!!",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like
1865,2718239,1,missing,United States,"Having spent three days at the Disneyland Paris resort, I have nothing but praise for the Park, the entertainers, and the sheer magic of the Park. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, and it was superb..My only complaint is with the food in the actual Park, huge lines, expensive, and the food was stone cold..The Disney name stands for quality, tradition, and is known the world over for it's love of children, and keeping the magic alive. Why would Disney endorse this dreadful food? If Disney needs to put the emphasis, and focus on the entertainment, hotels, etc, (Which it does with the most amazing stunning detail, quality, and perfection) Why can't you put the horrible food, served under your name and flagship, out to tender? McDonalds would be better than stone cold food..slow service, and disappointment.  This is the ONLY aspect that gives cause for complaint, and it does take some of the magic away..and leave a nasty taste..literally.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

1867,2506710,2,missing,United States,"I will start off by saying that comments around the non Disney things are mostly negative. Not because I'm biased but b c they honestly were frustrating, unclean, or awful...sometimes all of the above. :( DLP itself was nice but NO comparsion to WDW in Orlando...didn't have the same feel, the same level of commitment from its staff, nor the same visitor enthusiasm (we only saw 3 other people besides us wearing Disney gear there). However, I must say that the Disney store itemsthey had were great, but I haven't seen the ones in Orlando for a yr now.EUROSTAR: We arrived by Eurostar (hi speed via the chunnel) from London's Waterloo station...nice ride. Filthy train, and we were in first class (stains all over the seats and floor; the bathroom lookedas if it had never been cleaned and the toilet paper was the equivalent of newspaper). They served a snack that consisted of a small can of OJ, ham cheese sandwich, croissant, yogurt and cereal bar. I know the company is struggling and now I know why. First class is NOT worth the $100 dollar upgrade.The Eurostar ends at Disneyland Paris. So, when you exit the station there's Disney Village, Disney Studios and Disneyland...very convenient. This is also the bus depot to all the hotels.HOLIDAY INN: From there we got on the bus to the Holiday Inn. Ok, why someone didn't remind me that we're going to Disney and the HI is NOT Disney I'll never know. For some reason it's rated higher than the Newport Bay club Sequoia on the Disney site (I'll never understand why...it is NOT a deluxe hotel by any stretch...the lobby alone is NOcomparison to the Disney hotel lobbies at DLP)...but between the rating and the $600 savings by booking directly via the HI inn website that's why we chose it. Believe me when I tell you that Iwould have paid more than $600 to avoid the buses at all costs and stay at a Disney hotel that's walking distance to the parks and train!! Not to mention that the hotel is 'cold' in its feel, extremely noisy, and much understaffed. We spent a great deal of time each day waiting in line to ask questions at the front desk. We often had to call several times to follow up on requests to housekeeping for iron requests. The rooms were on the small side for the money although the bathrooms were a decent size. Our room (Family Room) had a queen bed and a set of bunk beds along with a crib...it was crowded. I understand the 'Kid Suites' are a 2 room set up and much larger.BUSES: The bus transportation to Disney property but non Disney hotels was awful. The drivers never spoke a word, not even to tell you which hotel he just abruptly stopped at forcing you to become onewith the window or your neighbor, and heaven forbid he ever offered assistance. The drivers would fill the buses beyond capacity and then drive as if they were a Nascar racer. No, I'm not exaggerating. Not to mention the wait at the depot.SAD BUS EXAMPLE: Once my husband rode the bus alone to the Village to get some food and bring it back to the room (my son and I were in the room sick with some awful flu bug so he wanted to be in the room to take care of us and our daughter who didn't catch it...the HI REFUSED to let him takeaway the dinner food  although they let you do so with breakfast  which forced him to go to the Disney village). Upon returning he squeezed on the bus and was followed by a mother pushing her daughter in a wheelchair. My husband attempted to help, with baked potatoes in hand, no one else would assist the mother or my husband. The woman shouted to the driver 'you're supposed to lower the ramp!', he never did. Never said a word, nor did and of the other tourists (really, it was for the most part the most rude group of tourists I have ever been confined with). This forced the poor girl to crawl out of the chair and up into the bus. When it was time for the woman to get off a man next to my husband said, 'glad she's gone, she was grumpy'. Luckily the woman was w in earshot and returned to inform the man that her daughter has terminal cancer and that this was her last holiday. That about sums up all of our frustrating and sad bus experiences.PARKS: The parks are a bit smaller, but still very enjoyable. We were in no way park commandos, just out for a trip to see another part of Disney. I will offer this important show TIP...the Legend of the Lion King show always had a line of 1 2 hrs and sold out every time. Not wanting to wait in theline we went to lunch in the adjoining building, Hyperion Cafe. Low and behold they are the same building. Get your food, get a seat and watch the show while you eat!!!! You actually eat your meal a few rows above people that have just stood in line for 2 hrs and are likely tired and hungry by now! Note that they will not let you sit without your food.DISNEYLAND HOTEL: We stopped in the Disneyland hotel, which is actually part of the grand entrance to DLP. The hotel inside was beautiful and the staff so friendly. We wanted to cry when we walkedin...we should have followed our guts and changed hotels from the moment we arrived at the HI like we wanted to.DISNEYS NEWPORT BAY CLUB HOTEL: From there we walked over to the Newport Bay Club, which is thru the Disney Village. Again, we walked in here and felt 'home'! We thought we were back in Orlando. Again, tears. The staff was friendly. Of the staff we encountered there was some language barrier which surprised us, although most werestill helpful, except for the concierge. We had dinner at their more casual restaurant and it was wonderful. They have a fantastic kids buffet, which was so nice for them to have so many options.DISNEY VILLAGE: Much smaller than Downtown Disney in Orlando, much smaller. Mostly restaurants and counter service. We ate at the Chicago Steakhouse...great food, great atmosphere!PRIORITY SEATING: Of all the times we made reservations we had our pick of times, even at the last minute. I'm really not sure where everyone else was eating! The restaurants were EMPTY!!PARIS: We also took the RER train to Paris for a day and walked a lot...GREAT Disney store at the Champs Elsyees!!! Good ride, about 45 min.So, all in all a good trip, if we take out the HI and the buses. :) I would HIGHLY recommend staying at a Disney hotel (park passes are included in the reservation and I was told the hotels cannot bebooked w o including the passes). If you do not stay at a Disney hotel, I would next highly recommend staying at a hotel on the RER line...it was SO much easier to get on and off the train than it ever was to take the bus! I would skip the non Disney 'in the Magic' hotels.",Disneyland_Paris,3,hotel disnei book room park stai dai food meal wait breakfast disneyland time kid pari

The stuff is quite friendly but... it  s all about money. The more you buy, the more they smile. It is not exactly an environment protecting company either...

We had a great night and the best meal we had during our visit.We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which has excellent facilities and is very near the park. The park staff are pleasant and helpful.However, visitors should also be aware of some of the down sides as they could spoil your holiday experience.The adult visitors from Spain and France are extremely rude and think nothing of pushing young children out of the way to secure their own view of the parades etc. The service in the restaurants is dire (unsmiling and grumpy) and the toilets throughout the park are disgusting.There were large queues for the shows so you need to get to the line early if you want to see them   they are well worth the wait though.The worst thing though was Charles De Gaulle airport   Terminal 1. It was very dirty and worn. The toilets are few in number and very dirty. Their are very few facilities if your plane is delayed   no cafe or facilities within the security area.I would not return to Paris again but am now planning a trip to America   something I didn't think I would want to do.",Disneyland_Paris,9,ride park disnei time queue dai disneyland wait peopl staff hour pari food visit like

If you want to just do the rides, this is great, but if your looking for that old fashion magic, go to the USA. The characters come out without minders watching and its kaos to get a picture, kids will leave dissapointed. Staff are light on the ground, so you have to rely on the maps. All in all it was very expensive and lacks the spirit. Its like Disney didnt run it, or they left  Walt  manual at home in the USA. I am not pro US by any means, but I think its important to understand the limitations especially if your making the trip just for the park.
