0,669660324,2,2018-10,United States,It is no doubt a legendary place but I just dont think it's worth the money and headache of overcrowding and overpriced everything. Disney continues to raise the price of admission and the crowds are ridiculous every single day. There are plenty of things to do in SoCal that are cheap or free. Save your family hundreds of dollars and go somewhere else. ,Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like
1,669505006,1,missing,United States,"I   ve been to Disneyland several times in the past 3 decades. This visit, I sensed the employees were disgruntled or unhappy. Very few smiles from the staff. In addition, the staff was prowling for people crossing the ropes while Fantasmic was on. Why do we need a Fastpass to enter to watch the Fan tasmic show when everyone has been situated and there is tons of space for paying customers without a Fastpass? See attached picture. Through the whole show, the entire space was unoccupied while there were 5 8 yr olds next to us straining to catch a glimpse.If you wanna pay $129 to stand in line for hours to ride an average of 9 rides that last 3 to 11 minute, this is the place for you. Disneyland has become so greedy that they overcrowd by double capacity just to make money without a care for their customers. It   s ridiculous to have minimal places to sit and rest with this large of a park.

So we had to leave and come back again.Then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying, but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn   t even visible as they are working on it or something. It was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us.We should have been told as we   d have left the park for another LA holiday and not wasted $300.Disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment The only good thing was out breakfast in the Carnation Cafe where the staff were superb and the Apple cinnamon pancakes to die for.All in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to Disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

I have never experienced so many rude and obnoxious staff throughout the park as we did this time. If the staff are that unhappy with their jobs or pay then step aside and give a job to someone who wants to work. Disney has just turned into a massive cash cow who can't handle the large crowds but keep jamming people into the park until it becomes uncomfortable. We were fully aware of the large crowds of the Christmas period but disneyland promoted activities for you to enjoy and when we arrived at these events people were being moved along by staff, saying that you cannot stand there.Disney have made WiFi available in the park aswell and this just leads to people not watching where they are going because all people are doing is looking at phones instead of watching where they are walking.Do yourself a favor and go to Knotts Berry Farm, its a lot cheaper and not as crowded.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

This is so wrong on many levels. Honest paying customers having to wait in line longer while others jump the queue. I absolutely hate what the fast pass allows. It makes my blood boil as these rich people jump the queue ahead of me. From listening to others in the lines, others agree.

The new system has doubled the wait times in the stand by lines because as they will tell you  fast pass riders have priority.  Under the old system you pulled a fast pass ticket for free. When you time to use it came you stood in a short line. While you waited for the fast pass time you stood in a line. Now you either stand in a line for fast pass if you can get one or you stand in a line with a few hour wait time. This was all a scheme for Disney to make more money and in the end it made things worse as far as wait times go.,Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

DISNEYLAND CASTLE I couldn   t believe that there wasn   t any notifications to advise you are renovating the castle and it   s currently all covered up. We missed our chance for the iconic photo in front of the castle. WORKING RIDES. we wasted so much time on your broken down rides. We were stuck inside Splash Mountain for 30mins and then escorted out of the canoes, through the attraction and out to the backlot. There was no apology. Indiana Jones broke down 3 times. My husband and daughter were stuck for 45mins and we were turned around twice due to the ride malfunctioning. Haunted Mansion closed as we approached with our fast pass and then we went up to Roger Rabbit in ToonTown only to be told the ride is closed after lining up. Then being part of an angry mob of people who were turned away and having to rejoin the back of the queue when it reopened. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APP TO ADVISE WHEN RIDES ARE CLOSED!FIX YOUR WIFI Your wifi reminds me of Australia   s NBN, never working and only available in a couple of spots around the place. In 2019, it   s a minimum to offer wifi especially with a large percentage of international travellers. CROWD CONTROL last Thursday, I felt like a sardine. There must be a limit to the number of people who can access this place. It was really unpleasant being squashed in a crowd with young children and aggressive pram pushers. THE GOOD? Fast passes and golden hour. I would have left Disney without these options. Also having the option to go to California Adventure Park. It   s a shame that it   s taken me 44 years to get to Disneyland and although I enjoyed my day, it was Ted the magical experience that I hoped for.

It   s unfair in a very cruel way. They won   t look at your doctors notes. You have to explain,or beg, why your child, should be allowed a pass, Which I kinda get but at the same time, find it very discriminatory. I don   t think they like they way I looked. He didn   t even listen to me. Said he didn   t understand big words, medical terms mean nothing to him, he is not a doctor. He was beyond rude . He was outright mean. I picked a Disney vacation because they cater to families with disabled children. Or at least I thought they did. We were celebrating my daughters last chemo. Which is great and all, but unfortunately because of 28 MONTHS of intense chemo and the high dose steroids to treat blood cancer she has severe osteonecrosis, which we can   t treat because it requires total joint replacement of her ankles, knees and hips, which is not possible during treatment, so we have to wait until her anc comes back with normal numbers and she is healthy enough to undergo such intense surgery. In about 3 months. Until then she lives in intense pain which is ongoing for over a year.  Osteonecrosis is dead bone. My daughters is extremely severe. It   s an extremely painful condition. But that didn   t qualify her for a pass. But a lady standing next to me, her son didn   t like loud noises, he got a pass. I was mind blown. I didn   t even go seeking this out. A cast member, an employee of Disney told me to go do this. To get a DAS pass after seeing her struggle to stand and wince in pain while meeting tinkerbell . The man assessing whether or not my daughter was disabled enough for a pass looked me dead in the eye and asked me why i brought her to Disneyland if she was sick and in pain. What kind of question in that?? I thought it was Disneyland. The happiest place on earth. She has at least 12 major upcoming surgeries, she has been on treatment for cancer for over two years. Why wouldn   t I bring her to Disneyland? We could have went there for a make a wish trip, but she wished something else. She later expressed her desire to have went to Disney and I took her on my own make a wish, and even though Disneyland is actually quite crappy to disabled people. I still got to see her smile and light up at seeing the parade. The joy on her face was contagious at meeting tinkerbell. All in, I   m glad she got to complete her dream of going to Disneyland. She could only do about 3 hours a day, on a 3 day pass. But it   s whatever. We came and saw. We rode 1 ride a day.

For the amount of money Disney brings in and charges they should be ashamed of the condition of the park. Just slapping new paint on old rides and giving it a new name.

My Mom mentioned that this was the quiet time for Disney and she bought my daughter a 3 day pass for her third birthday (so we also had to buy 3 day passes for ourselves costing over $400). What a mistake. We were done with Disney after just one day. All you do all day long is wait in lines.

Then you will wait in line for a ride (sometimes a 2 hour wait), then you will wait in line to meet a single Disney character (usually a 30 40 minute wait), then you will wait in a line for crappy overpriced food, then you will wait in a line to see one of the shows, then you will wait in line to use a single change table in the washrooms (there should be more than one change table in the washrooms at a children   s theme park), then you will wait in line trying to buy a souvenir, then you will wait in line to get back on the tram, and then you will wait in line in traffic trying to exit the park.

22,649674980,2,2019-1,United States,"In summary, Disneyland and Disney California Adventure are not worth the price they charge. For starters, the crowds. We went on a Monday and a Wednesday in January, and it was still extremely crowded. For example, just to get into the park, it took me 45 minutes to get through the security bag check (more on this later). By the time we made it into the parks, the lines for most rides were already 60 90 minutes long. We did utilize the Fastpass system, but it is so limited in how it   s used that you will inevitably be spending time in standby lines throughout the day. On Monday, we arrived at 9:15am and left at 5:30pm. We rode 6 rides. For most of the day, the Cars ride was a 120 minute wait. In addition, the food and restaurants are way overpriced. We did the Blue Bayou (their nicest restaurant, which you need to reserve a month ahead of time due to the crowds), and the Galactic Grill (their budget eatery). The Blue Bayou has price tags that would have passed for a very fancy restaurant. However, we weren   t that impressed with the food. We all agreed that we   ve had better food at chain restaurants than Disneyland   s version of an upscale place. And the Galactic Grill was straight up awful. The kids burger, which was $8, was literally a slider sized sandwich that consisted of two flat and bland buns resting on a dry, thin meat patty. My kids were horrified. We had eaten at In N Out the day before (which is cheaper and far superior) and my kids couldn   t get over how awful their Disneyland burger was. For the price of admission that they are charging now, I am convinced that I do not get my money   s worth. Due to the crowds, in order to experience more than a few things, you either have to go multiple days, or purchase a Maxpass, both of which cost even more money, and in my opinion still don   t deliver. If you do end up going, I would strongly recommend bringing your own food and water. Their food is horrible, and very expensive. We did this the second day we went, and it was a much more pleasant experience. This does necessitate that you bring a bag or backpack, which means you will have to go through the security bag check. So I would recommend getting to the park early so that you don   t end up waiting an hour just to get into the ticketing area! We did this the second day too, arriving at 8:15am (the parks open at 9am). It was still mobbed with people, but I was able to get in by 8:50am. Use the Fastpass system as much as you can. You will still end up waiting in line, usually around 10 20 minutes, but it   s much better than 60 90 minutes. The Maxpass would be nice, since it allows you to obtain a Fastpass from your phone as well as have multiple Fastpasses, but it   s an extra $15 per ticket. We just weren   t willing to give any more money to Disney after such a crazy admission price. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the rides definitely are quality rides. They are fun and exciting and tell a story. And the park is very clean. But as I   ve stated multiple times, it just wasn   t worth it in the end.

Unfortunately, I feel an obligation to tell people  especially people who pay lots of money for travel and accommodations   that Disneyland is not what it used to be. Disneyland is very expensive.

I remember the days when ride closures would be announced ahead of time, but these closures were intermittent and seemingly random. We would stand in line for awhile and then be told that the ride had to be taken down for maintenance. In addition, we sometimes had trouble finding a restroom that was open. Three times throughout the day, we were actually turned away from restrooms. For the price that we paid, I really expected more.

You would have to plan meals to bring if you want to save. On top of that LONG lines waiting for a one minute ride. Fast track pass, ridiculous, it's a waste of money. You would have to arrive at the park really early to make a good use of it and you'll be lucky to get 3 rides with a fast pass. I honestly do not think it's worth spending your money here. You will have a way enjoyable and relaxing vacation going somewhere else where it's not overly expensive, crowded, and waiting from 70 to 160mins   2.5hrs for a one minute ride! Characters? It's about luck on busy days. You want rides or meet characters? How about shows? No way! Unless you have enough time and money to spend to everything, but you will not do it in less than 3 days. Not the happiest place on earth after 3hrs here. We had good experience in the past when kids were not in school, but now vacation will be planned somewhere worth going.

The cost was never an issue as we have been to DisneyWorld in Fla many times and realize that while it is expensive, it was always worth it for the memories and the experience. The only memories we are going to bring away from our visit to DisneyLand are going to be off outrageous wait times on every ride ( and that was after waiting for 2 hours in a line to get through security despite getting there at 8.30am )the frustration of not being able to use the Maxpass because use is severely restricted. Once we booked our Maxpass on one ride, we were not allowed to book another for at least 2 hours. The reason for this was never given and befuddles me. When we were able to book another ride on Maxpass there were no times available for hours. All in, it was a terrible experience and I can say we will never be back.

And now that they own franchises like Star Wars and Marvel, then it seems like more incentive for me to visit, right?Not really.Disneyland is a victim of their own success. It's way too overcrowded and yes, I understand that it's supposed to appease children, but the sheer amount of people pushing baby strollers was ridiculous. I heard that they allow folks to ride electric scooters. That wouldn't be such a bad idea if the walking lanes were not so densely populated. The lines to wait on some of the rides (at least the ones I wanted to ride) were unbearable. So my judgement is based on how much I paid to enter versus what I was actually able to enjoy when I was there. I keep hearing people say you have to go early. So let me get this straight;Instead of being among the thousands, I will be among hundreds that are also early birds?If I showed up right when the gates open, I could probably squeeze in one more ride but it also meant that I had to stay 2 or so more hours at the park to get in that one extra ride. By the time I'm finished that, I'll be among thousands once again.All it means is that I would have to stay there longer and for what you pay, it's not really worth it.Just go if it's something you have to take off your bucket list or if you've never been to any Disney themed park.

44,632456005,1,2018-10,United States,"I visited Disneyland on October 19th and 20th. I normally visit during the summer over the for two three days for the Fourth of July. I love the fireworks and it has become a family tradition. I am the Disney fanatic of my family and I am the person in the family that ensures that each child gets a trip to Disneyland or Disneyworld. I have noticed over the past 10 years or so that Disney's service, food and crowds have all gone through marked change and not towards the positive. On this particular trip I flew my sister, brother in law, brother, son and toddler niece for a weekend for my niece's first Disney trip. I had not visited in the fall in some years and was not prepared for the crowds. When we arrived from our walk from our hotel the security line was almost to the main entrance on Harbor boulevard. We survived the hour wait to get to the security station by entertaining the two year old between the five of us. When we finally got in we had to wait in another almost hour long line to get the DAS for my son. He has a medical condition that makes it inadvisable to stand in crowded lines in close proximity with other people. We had used the DAS on several of our other trips to Disneyland and found the Disneyland the best out of all of the places we had visited including DisneyWorld and Universal Studios. This is a large part of why I continued visit Disney even after he went through a life threatening experience. He loves Disney just as much as I do so I try to find ways to make sure he can still visit. Both parks were super packed and we quickly learned that everything was abnormal on this visit. Two members of our party kept falling off of the DAS (they told me they were having glitches with the system that day). The lines were ridiculously long; like Christmas time long (e.g. Pirates was a 180 minute wait). I rode a total of four rides between the two parks the entire day. Child Swap was also not being utilized in ways that it had been previously. We were told that one parent would have to wait outside the ride and then wait in the fast pass line by alone in order to ride (which made for double the time and was no longer child swap). So my sister and brother in law were able to ride a total of two rides each. The lines for every restaurant, quick service etc. were tremendously long. Overall the entire trip was a lot of standing in line with little to show for it. I am a Disney veteran and have only experienced lines like this during Christmas and New Years at DisneyWorld. When I go during those times I already have the expectation that I will not really be riding rides, I go for the Christmas activities and decorations. This trip was, unfortunately an expensive mistake. This was my first Disney experience where I had regrets for visiting the parks. It was a disappointment all around. I did talk to Guest Services (waiting in line again) about my initial issues with DAS not working. I also wrote to Disney about many of the numerous things that went wrong while I was there that I have not recounted in this review but have not received any response (which is not Disney like) They are normally the gold standard for guest service. This felt like an alternate reality Disney experience for me and I sincerely hope it is not indicative of a  new Disney normal .",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

I thought Disneyland Anaheim was way much better since it's more expensive, much bigger and prides itself as the  original . But it's not! The 9:30pm fireworks show was suddenly discontinued, with no given reason at all! We waited inconveniently standing for an hour inside a roped area, for the fireworks show to start with all those excited people who travelled from all over the world, only to be cut abruptly. Big letdown! My senior parents looked forward to the stage shows. Sadly, we were so bored. The railroad train was so boring and a huge waste of time, nothing substantial to see. Queues for the attractions were so long that you'll lose all the patience still left in you. The Pixar Play Parade, hmm just ok. I wanted my parents to experience mickey mouse, donald duck, cinderella, snow white, lion king, aladdin, and the gang. My parents don't know those pixar characters. Suggestion: why not make 2 sets of parades instead, to cater to all your customers since you mentioned you're a family oriented, recommended for all ages, happiest place on Earth? Fantasmic was really nice but, having no available tickets left, we were pushed to an overcrowded area, standing uncomfortably for an hour with very limited vision to the show. It was shown just twice, to think that there were hundreds of thousands of paying customers and I'm sure at least 80% of them wanted to see Fantasmic.

A meal itself Cost us around 30 dollars, which was just basic scrambled egg and breakfast potatoes, I don   t know how it   s actually possible for a full family to visit, I feel sorry that people save all year round to go somewhere where you   re basically in a queue to just walk.

The bottom line is that there are too many people in the parks, the lines are too long, and you can barely move. The Walt Disney Company   s brilliant solution: charge you extra money to use their    maxpass   . That system allows you to make fast pass reservations on your phone. Essentially you pay extra to get access to the fast pass system to save time. You can also get new fast passes quicker than if you don   t buy the maxpass. More money for the Mouse and you get a small break from the crowds. Then the system breaks down   no refund offered. At that point you can wait on another line for 30 minutes for a single fast pass to    make up    for the fact that the maxpass you paid for is broken. Then all of the rides are backed up because the system is broken. So you get in line and wait, because well you   re here and you paid, then a mumbled announcement worse than a New York subway car sounds overhead. After standing still for a few minutes you understand that what has happened is the ride has broken down while you have been waiting and there is no recourse other than to accept you just paid to do nothing for the past 90 minutes. At that point you realize that you just paid almost a $800 for a 2 day visit to the parks (with a broken maxpass) to wait in line for a broken ride   which essentially amounts to Goofy holding your arms behind your back while an obnoxious Orange County teen spits in your face. Meanwhile you try to think back to the great memories you had when competent humans actually ran this place. As for the people running it now   they should be shown the door, because it   s one thing to overcharge for something that   s a fun memory filled day, it   s another to provide an awful day of nothing. As a long time Disney fan and visitor it saddens me to say that Universal Studios has finally surpassed Disney as a total, well run experience.

Who I don't have a lot of respect for are the greedy corporate shills that have taken Walt's vision for Disneyland and tossed it out the window in the name of profit maximization. It's pretty ridiculous, and last weekend's trip to Disneyland will be my last. Here are a few cold, hard truths about Disneyland:1) Way too crowded all day everyday. There is no off season.2) Ridiculously long waits for rides (because it is too crowded)3) Fast pass system inefficient (because it is too crowded)4) Obscenely expensive everything (all goods made in china cheap quality)5) Terrible food (minimal healthy choices stupid expensive)6) Terrible value for the amount of $$$ spent (you pay to stand in line)7) People are herded around like human cattle (it's disheartening to watch)8) There are lines for everything (and I mean everything)Overall, I can't imagine why any would want to drop hundreds, and even thousands of $$$ to essentially stand in line all day for a few minutes of fun.

68,618246295,1,2018-9,United States,"Big Disney fan my whole life. I've been on multiple trips to Disneyland, Disney World, and Disneyland in Paris throughout my life. I loved them all. Our last trip to Disneyland (September 2018) was a complete nightmare. We picked one of the lowest seasons of the year, knowing that some rides and attractions would be closed. It was worth it for us because we thought we would be avoiding big crowds.Instead, we found many many rides closed, AND the biggest crowds we have ever seen there. Incredibly hard to walk around and get anywhere. Long lines at all the rides. Families stressed out and rushing all over the park. Horrible, horrible atmosphere.The magic is completely GONE. You can't even appreciate the beauty of the park because people are in the way. People are EVERYWHERE.If anyone remembers the magic and the music and simply strolling around and enjoying everything in sight (during low season), that is gone forever.All we found were stressed out moms, sweating and pulling their kids all over the park, racing to get to rides before everyone else did. If you don't rush, you're doomed.Remember when you would run into characters and actually be able to spend some time with them? That does not happen anymore. If you want to spend 3 seconds with Minnie, stand in line for at least 20min. If you're lucky, you'll get to her. Normally you won't, and have to wait some more for the next character. If you want to say hi to Captain America or Spiderman or Black Panther, be prepared to wait in line for 40min or longer.This is LOW SEASON, people. I can't even imagine the park being fuller than it was. It seemed impossible to us that more people could fit. But when we went, crowd levels were at 2 10!!!!Cast members are no longer kind and warm. They are all completely stressed out and rude and even mean. No wonder. Their job of keeping things together is very hard.Horrible, horrible and very disappointing experience for my whole family. I had spent years telling my kids all about the magic of Disneyland, and none of it is left.If Disney doesn't limit crowds somehow, I don't think we'll ever be going back. The park is beautiful.

But since moving to Los Angeles Disneyland which you think should be the leader pales in comparison. For a start it   s a real drag to get there from LA in traffic but hardly the parks fault. The problems start with the jobsworth attitude and impersonal service and how miserable employees are and the sheer magnitude of people they let into the park. This time though really takes the biscuit and we aren   t even going for another 2 weeks. My older daughter wanted to save and pay for our 3 adopted kids to go for Halloween. She saved up all summer and we helped her out.Then my 8 year old broke her leg and will be days away from getting her cast off when we are due to go. We imagined that Disney would let us change the date as there was still availability.But they will not budge they say we need to pay again and donate our existing tickets! This will be our last visit to Disneyland we will make the effort to go to Disney world next year where we know we will have a great experience.I might add that we were able to have Great Wolf Lodge allow us to cancel our booking. Other relatives from the U.K. who are meeting us there Were all able to change their plans but Disney is so focused on the bottom line that all they see are the $$$$.

Well I have to say that this experience was a massive disappointment and when compared with our experience at Universal just appalling.In this land of magic and dreams we found all the staff to be miserable and unhelpful they just looked so depressed and like they didn   t want to be there, they didn   t make us feel welcome and with me being blind I received no support at all be it getting on or off rides or help with queues.In our day we managed just 4 rides yes just 4 rides, it was way too overcrowded we knew that in August it would obviously going to be busy and hot, but there was no shade whilst waiting for rides and very minimal shade whilst walking around the park, in one queue we were in a lady fainted due to the lack of shade and heat. Many queues were 45 80 minutes long which doesn   t help. Another issue that made things worse was that the fast track queues had such an impact on everyone more of them were getting pushed along leaving everyone else behind. I don   t have an issue with people paying the extra to get ahead, but Disney really need to control numbers here as it significantly penalises others.Out of the four rides we went on at Disney, I would say that the Space Mountain rollercoaster is best and not to be missed, that   s if you can get on. As you would expect the gift shops are pricy, as is food and drink (although comparing favourably with similar attractions), it just seemed to take the mick being charged a further 20 dollar for parking on top of an already pricey 97 dollars for a ticket.This was a birthday treat and first visit for my partner, who was extremely disappointed.

It   s level all around the park itself.In terms of access to the rides for wheelchair scooter users     here   s the deal     you can book a    Return Time    this means you go to the ride you want to do and you organise a time when you   ll come back and do it which is comparable to the time you would have spent in the queue. You can only have ONE return time active at any one time    We didn   t realise this and went to book a return time on another ride and was then told that was how it worked, by this point we   d been in the park 2 hours and not actually been on a ride so I went slightly ballistic saying something like  this was the worst place I'd ever been to in my life  and the woman very kindly gave us a few    Fast Passes    which give you access to the rides via the exit.That was very nice of her, she also let us onto the ride she was on which was the Peter Pan ride which was way too tame for my 11 and 13 year old but at least we had got on something!We then used a Fast Pass to get on Matterhorn Bobsleds    now I have a disability which means my neck isn   t the greatest and this ride was a bone shaker and I couldn   t wait to get off it! I   m sure it would be fun if you didn   t have any bone issues but it was very much an old, jolting rollercoaster.Space Mountain was a more modern rollercoaster and I had something to lean my head neck on so that was much better and great fun     in fact my children did that one 3 times.Pirates of the Carribean was OK     we   d booked a return time   I wouldn   t say it was worth a 2 hour wait.The boys enjoyed riding cars in Autopia which we went on as it had the shortest queue.And that was the sum total of rides we went on during a 9 hour visit, at a cost of $117 each plus $20 for parking plus $7.99 for one slice of pizza in a horrible    restaurant       I   ll leave you to decide that makes it good value for money but personally it one in a lifetime stuff     not because it was amazing but more because we sort of felt we    should    take the kids.Later in the holiday we found ourselves on The Beach Boardwalk in Santa Cruz   $40 for an all day pass to all the rides, virtually no queues for anything and some thrilling rides     my son went on 12 rides in less than 3 hours there!

The park is unbelievably clean. With this many people, I'd have expected it to be a mess. But honestly, it was clean everywhere. Kudos to the maintenance staff.2. The parking and the tram to the park were very easy to use   other than the fact that the parking ramp isn't marked very well, so it's easy to get turned around. The tram ride was comfortable and fast.What they did wrong:1. The lines for the rides were ridiculous, and very deceptive. We'd walk to a ride and see not many people standing by it, get in line and suddenly the line would turn a corner, or go inside a building and there would be 400 people in front of you. We were there for six hours and rode exactly four rides.2. You better be in your seat an hour and a half ahead of time for the fireworks display. If not, baton waving teenagers will herd you around and around, sending you in different directions while the show is going on. This one really pissed me off. I wanted a picture of me with my family with the castle and the fireworks in the background. We finally found someone willing to take our picture (another visitor), and just as we were getting ready, some knucklehead employee starts waving his baton at us and shouting at us to  keep it moving or leave the park.  No picture. We left the park... never to return.3. We downloaded the Disneyland App, which has a section on it for  Disney Photos    you know, the ones they take of you just as you are screaming down a ride? After coaxing my 14 y.o. daughter to finally go on a  big  ride, we went to check out the photos. The look on my daughter's face in the picture was priceless, and we all had a great laugh about it. I wanted to buy the picture, so I went to the photo booth near the ride and asked to buy it. The employees both told me that the picture would be available on the app in a matter of minutes, so there was no need to buy it unless I wanted them to print it out. I decided that I could print it on my own, and they both assured me that was the best way to do it. We went on our way, and later when I went back on to the app to see the picture, it wasn't there. So now we have no picture. When someone wants to spend money at your business, it makes sense to let them spend it, not talk them out of it. Dumb.I could go on and on about how commercialized the place is. Everything is for sale. And nothing is cheap. And the rides aren't exciting.

We paid   450 for our family to visit yet only had time for 4 rides in the whole day (and we arrived early). You can always pay more for fast track tickets but we felt we had already paid more than enough. I really don't agree with the fast track system anyway   giving priority to those with the most money. If the fast track system wasn't in place then overall waiting times would be far shorter. Again, it's clearly all about the money for them now.

You also expect your family to be treated at least equally but better being that you frequent the park and spend on many of their amenities. Sadly, being an annual passholder has negatives that I never expected.When we arrived at the gate, the guy scanning the tickets said there is something wrong with our pass and he had to wait to get the manager. They let me wife go in and daughter but made me wait outside the gate which felt like an eternity. I was embarrassed to watch as many people just constantly go in which the  manager  had to do their rounds. It didn't help that the guy doing the scanning felt that other customers had higher priority even though I was ahead of them so he had the manager take their requests first.Finally, the manager said, yes, there is a problem with the annual pass. She required my driver license and then left again as I waited some more time. Finally coming back and saying that I can go in. It's unfortunate that I would be mistreated this way. It could have been easily resolved by putting me inside the gate which letting the manager do their processing. Instead, I have to wait outside the gate while constant adults, kids, and babies get let in while I am embarrassingly just sitting outside the gate. A kid even started touching my phone because I was waiting and he saw something interesting on my phone.I have written and even called customer service at Disney Land about my complaints. They responded after I called multiple times and said that they would remedy the situation. I have never heard back from them since. I feel they only would do something if they knew it was a liability concern where they would get in trouble. To the normal frequent customer that just leaves comments, they don't care about.

I had already been in line for about 15 minutes just to order, which wasn   t too bad. But to wait 45 min to get the food was unbelievable and then one of our kabobs was raw. In hindsight we should have used mobile ordering. I think the thing that really did it for us were the numerous large families that were blatantly cutting the line. I   m talking 8 12 ppl (no joke) pushing themselves thru or actually unhooking the chains. This happened quite frequently, it was unreal. It made me think this was the norm here.

We came back just before noon, but my unused FastPass reservation for Space Mountain disappeared from the app by no fault of my own.

I literally cried goodthing i have sunglasses on me. They said its their new policy. Whatever !

My four day trip that concluded five days ago was the first time I left disappointed. It just wasn't as much fun and the hospitality was just off. From wrong food orders at in park eateries (on two separate occasions) to poor crowd management to the several rides being  temporarily closed , it just wasn't a very pleasant experience this time around. Normally, the high priced tickets are easier to accept because they usually give a five star experience to you and your children. The cast members that were there the week of April 23rd just didn't seem  with it.  They mostly seemed indifferent to the experience we were having and that attitude had not been the case on my previous dozen or so visits. It was supposedly  Pixar Fest.  Aside from a couple posters and a change to the evening fireworks display, there was no way I could tell.I don't know if it was because significant portions of the park were under construction (especially California Adventure) or if they were not expecting crowds that big for the post Spring Break pre Summer period or if there is someone new in charge that is not properly motivating the employees. I just don't know. What I do know is that, for the first time, I am questioning if the amount of money I spent on this trip was worth it. Especially when you factor in the fact I stayed at the Disneyland Hotel. It is disappointing to think I could have spent a week in Hawaii for the same price and had a better experience.I hope whatever is going on is temporary.

145,574835235,2,2018-4,United States,"My husband and I brought our 3 year old son to Disneyland for a family vacation. We would do anything for him, and at the end of the day(s) I think he enjoyed himself and that is really what matters.That said, what a nightmare this experience turned out to be. Happiest place on Earth? More like Hell on Earth. I   m not sure where to begin. The night before we planned to go, we tried to purchase tickets on the app, but received error messages. We ended up calling some customer service number, and purchasing over the phone. We were told to pick up the tickets at will call. When we got to the park we somehow ended up in the line to actually enter the park, even though we were directed to that line as the    pick up ticket    line. When we realized this, my husband jumped out of line to go find the actual ticket booth. At this point, we   d already been waiting in line for quite a while. I tried to find some shade for my son and I to wait in. I guess we were in the way, and an employee actually asked if she needed to call security. When we finally got tickets, we went to the back of the entrance line. Again. Ok. Whatever. Possibly our mistake for being clueless newbies, even though we were directed to that line.Once we were about to enter, the man who took our tickets also needed to take our picture?? I was not aware pictures were taken, or for what purpose. So I wasn   t really prepared. He practically barked at me to remove my sunglasses. He followed this up by yelling at me that I was in the wrong line for the turnstile the stroller would fit through. Wow. Glad I was wearing my first time to Disneyland pin!Speaking of strollers, these were perhaps some of the crappiest strollers I   ve ever seen with very limited room for storing any items. Small, uncomfortable, dirty. This is Disney, I mean it   s supposed to be family friendly. In my humble opinion, they can do better.Once we were in the park, it really wasn   t much better of a scene. It was crazy crowded. People were bumping into us and the stroller. And I was fearful of hitting people with our stroller. I think I finally understand    packed in like sardines   . The waits for the preschool rides were 30 45 minutes (followed by like 3 minutes of actual ride time), which doesn   t exactly scream kid friendly to me. Thank goodness I was prepared with distractions and ice water. (Ironically, we ran into a    cast member    later, who told us it was a slow day and to imagine ten times more people and waits of 4 8 hours. Ummmmmm where is the magic in that experience?!) Speaking of    cast members   , I could not believe how unhappy so many of the employees looked. If we spoke to a dozen employees over our two day visit, I can think of two that were    bubbly   . The rest apeared tired, grumpy, and uneager to assist. I actually felt guilty for asking the few newbie questions I asked. In addition to this, I heard    cast members    grumbling about    not being scheduled for break   . We encountered more employees (you could tell from the name badges), that we didn   t interact with, and so many just looked ridiculously unhappy. By this point, I couldn   t wait to meet the characters who I was certain would bring the magic. And this brings me to perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole experience. For months we told our son about how he would get to meet the characters. We really played it up. I mean he   s three, so meeting the characters was bound to be the highlight of the trip for him. Over two days, we saw Belle from afar, the evil queen from Snow White from afar and Pluto. Pluto shook my little guy   s hand but was gone before we could get a picture or an autograph. Thank goodness I had booked a character breakfast (for which we were seated 35 minutes after our reserved time) where we    met    Mickey, Minnie, Daisy and Stitch. If I had not, we would have only    met    Pluto. Whoop dee do. My little guy was so disappointed and kept asking where the characters were. At one point I mentioned something to the guy trying to sell us a vacation club membership, and he said there should be two characters    right over there   , but when he went to point, he was like    oh, they   re not there now   . Helpful. He ended up giving us a sticker. A for effort?I knew that our trip would be expensive, and that there would be crowds, and lines. But I honestly expected so much more for the ridiculous amount of money spent, and to be honest, from the name Disney. I guess we simply missed the magic that calls some people back for multiple visits. Before investing your money, and time, in a trip to Disneyland, do your research. I didn   t write this review only to rant. I   m not sure reading a review like this one would have deterred me from a visit, because I visited for the Kiddo, not myself. But after day two, I left feeling only like I   d completed a parenting rite of passage, like I checked something off of a lifelong to do list. I felt no magic, no wonder, no awe.

148,569798216,2,2018-3,United States,"My husband had a small soft bouncy ball my son had and was playing with prior to our departure from our resort before we boarded the shuttle to pass time. We took this into the park 3 times before the last time security took it out of my husbands backpack and said we had to    surrender it or take it to the car.    Because we took the shuttle, the car wasn   t an option. The security officer then went on to say that if we were caught in the park with a ball, we could be escorted out of the park. My son was so upset over this. He had just gotten that ball when we arrived in California. Keep in mind Disney sells balls very similar to the one my son brought in, it just didn   t have a mickey face on it. I was told that the reason they allow sales and possession of these same types of balls in the park was because    they   ve been checked over.    My son had not once taken that ball out of my husbands bag. He just had it to play with prior to us arriving to Disneyland. The chamber of commerce cast member did absolutely nothing with my complaint. The only person who truly cared was a cast member named Nina who was working in the guardians area on the night we were there. Thank god she was working, because she gave us a voucher for my son to use to replace the ball that was taken from him. She was kind and sweet and let me vent my frustrations about our experience with Disney. She was wonderful. She was the positive light in our day. When we were leaving the park we were told by the security officers that the    bin    (this is where they put all of the items they confiscate from their guests) is essentially off limits and will not be available for guests nor will they hold the item they take to be picked up at the end of the day. When I asked where they take all of the toys they take from these kids, I was told the trash compactor. Can you believe this??? A billion dollar company not even willing to donate the items they   ve wrongly taken. What is a small bouncy ball going to do Disney? I can see if it was out and being played with or causing disruption. But to take it because it   s considered sporting equipment (they have listed on their prohibited items online things like    helmets, baseball bats, hockey sticks) no where does it say bouncy balls. Come on Disney. Unbelievable. You won   t have to worry about escorting my family out of your park. We won   t be back. Also, half of their rides at California adventure park are being repaired or maintenanced so just be aware of that when you go as well. If a ride breaks down and guests had a fast pass to that ride, they   ll allow them to choose another ride (which is nice but not necessarily fair to the other guests who had a FASTPASS to the line with a ride working) so we waited 35 minutes to get on our fast pass ride. This situation went far beyond the $5 ball. We got my son another one. It   s the principle. We were treated as though we brought in a weapon.. and then told this    weapon    we brought was going in the    bin    and then to the trash with all of the other innocent not harmful items taken from kids. I appreciate security and what they do to keep everyone safe. I truly do. I respect their efforts, however, this was asinine and uncalled for. This was the item security found to be a threat and dangerous enough to get you escorted out of their park. Be on the lookout for these balls when you go and by all means DO NOT bring them to the park unless you want a heartbroken child and it put in the    bin   . They are hazardous and prohibited. Terrifying little thing isn   t it? ",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

We were blown away at how the Disney has been taken out of this park. It   s pretty close to just your average rundown old amusement park. Bus loads and I mean bus loads of unsupervised and disrespectful teenagers run rampant through the park. We spent several hours between groups in lines for the attractions and watched them ignore every sign to    stay off    etc. These signs acted like a dare to them. So here is the other problem. Fast passes and lines. Once you scan your fast pass the line often parallels the regular line. More than once we saw groups jumping a measly road to skip the regular line. Disney needs to put a second check station in to prevent the line jumpers. Only Space Mountain has this second check and you should have see the kids and even adults getting kicked out of the line. Lines for food, lines for bathrooms, lines for rides, lines for the security check (worse than and longer than the airport). Disney staff so rude that I wonder how they got a job (ok I   d be a little mad after dealing with the teenagers I just described) but tried to give them a bad day break. Glad to say we saw the original again but will go to World for the Disney experience. PS: Fastpass everything you can including all the night shows in all the parks.

This event was terrible. Now, yes, part of it was the circumstances. It had been raining a heavy pour all day and we were expecting the show to be cancelled. It was not. Instead we got to sit in wet chairs at soaking wet tables that a cast member could not even be be bothered to wipe a towel across. We were given a plastic lunchbox filled with  desserts,  half of which were stale cheeses and bread sticks. We were offered several alcoholic drinks and chose a vodka concoction which tasted like Juicy Juice mixed with Sprite. So we asked for the sparkling wine next, and it was alright. But when we asked for a second glass, we were told guests were limited to two drinks. Two drinks? For the price I had paid ($80 a head) each of should have received an entire bottle of wine. The show itself was no better than the Bellagio Fountains and since we were freezing, wet, and tired, we left early. Just walked out, later writing a letter to Disneyland about our experience, and actually receiving all of our money back.

159,566154102,2,2018-2,United Kingdom,"My other half is a bit of a Disney enthusiast to say the least so she loves it, but I have also enjoyed visiting Disney in Anaheim in the past, as well as Paris and WDW. This time we visited for 2 days and I something about the experience made me snap   I just couldn't help getting really angry at how much Disney are taking us all for a ride and how the general population seem either oblivious to it or happy to be treated with such contempt. I know it's silly but the thing that got me really thinking about it all was whilst using the rest room. Now I don't know about you but I have NEVER seen 1 ply toilet roll used anywhere I've ever been. Even the most awful cheap 1* motels I've had the misfortune of staying in don't use it. And yet Disney, somewhere that charges an incredible amount of money to enter, has the cheek to do this. What does it save their shareholders? A few pennies per roll probably. And whilst I was able to deal with the situation by quadruple rolling it up before using, what's a child who's probably never encountered see through toilet roll before going to do? Without getting too graphic, probably make a mess of their hand!After I'd noticed this, I just couldn't help but notice how much Disney has become a perfect example of corporate greed. At the same time I was shocked to see how the general population seemed to just accept situations and conditions that would be considered unacceptable pretty much anywhere else. It's almost as if people have paid so much money to get in that they are so determined to have a good time and so ignore what's going on. Obviously overcrowding is a major problem, but I would also say that the price of things in the park is the biggest insults to paying guests. For example $1.99   tax for A banana. Really? $2.99   tax for A pickle. I don't know how much these things normally cost in the US but a banana would be less than 20p ($0.30) and a pickle probably a little bit less. And $4 for a bottle of water when we all know you can buy one in a supermarket for $0.50 (or half that in Costco or the like!). Why do people put up with it?  Well it's Disney, you expect to pay more.  would be the response from die hard fans. I say a reasonable mark up is fair enough, but the prices for my examples are an insult to guests who have already paid over the odds to get in! Yet there they are   queues of people waiting to hand over their hard earned cash, knowing full well they're being ripped off and almost being grateful for it. My favourite was the queue for Dole Whip in Fantasy Land   no exaggeration there's around a 20 minute queue for people to purchase some whippy icecream and pineapple for $6   tax. Absolutely insane!Me and my partner had the lovely experience of queuing over half an hour for two portions of chicken nuggets and chips in Fantasyland (those plus two drinks in excess of $30) and then having to sit on the floor and eat them as all the seats had been taken.Then there's the queues for the rides. We visited as off season as you can get and yet there were queues of over an hour for childrens story book rides, queues of over two hours for bigger attractions and even a 45 minute queue to GET IN the park. Would anyone pay hundreds of dollars to visit literally anywhere else in America and accept that 45 minutes of your day was spent queuing to get in? I highly doubt it.I could go on, but I think my points above summarise my feelings well. Disney has become a greedy, uncaring Company and whilst at the moment the fans are putting up with it, one by one they will notice what's going on and (I hope) not come back to their parks or their hotels. The addition of Star Wars land next year could be the start of this as this will push the parks to capacity or beyond for several months and this is going to make paying guests miserable. I hope so anyway. I hope that Disneyland starts to see declining guests and a good kicking financially so that it can start going back to what it used to be. I will not be returning, despite my other half's protests! To everyone giving it 5 stars and saying it's magical, get real.

160,565612705,1,2018-2,United States,"Our family travels to Disney parks 2 3 times a year if not more and as a family of 5 this is not an affordable trip however we love Disney so much the expense is worth it! We usually go to Disney World however decided to take a quick trip to Disneyland this year. We purchased 3 day one park tickets for our family. We went to Disneyland park 2 days and California Adventure for one day. Before leaving we find out many rides were shut down as well as part of Main Street, which we had no choice at this point as flights were booked and time had been taken from work. The first day, February 21, we went to Disneyland park we tried to find the days that we could use our magic morning and the employees in the ticket booth were helpful in finding the days but in no way made the experience magical. Usually at park opening the train comes around with characters on it and a family to open the park and on this day the train arrived with no characters and they did a park opening with a family on the ground in front of park gates that no one could see and it wasn   t very enthusiastic. The process of getting into the park was tedious scan your ticket, take a photo (so your ticket cannot be used by anyone else) and sign your ticket, the gate employees are rather rude and just want to get you in and gone. Walking into the park our kids were excited so we headed toward the rides. The ride lines were longer than usual which may be because so many rides were closed at once. There was a strange incident while we were in line for the gadget coaster in Toontown. The ride was stopped and an announcement was made as if the ride had a maintenance issue. But come to find out there was a man that had a selfie stick and was trying to use it on the ride. We waited about 15 minutes until security got there to remove him and proceed to argue with him at the ride exit. We asked about fireworks and were told by an employee that fireworks were only on the weekends and depended on weather. We purchased some items at the store outside of Space Mountain and the employees were helpful and answered questions and helped us find the sizes we were looking for. There were no parades due to construction on Main Street and no fireworks on this day so we ended up leaving the park earlier than we normally would. Day 2 at Disneyland was what really made this trip awful! On day 2 my brother and his family joined us. My niece is autistic and gets sever anxiety when standing in long unending lines so my sister in law called ahead to make sure she would be able to get an ADA pass for the lines and she was told she could. We waited in line at Town Hall for what seemed like an hour. They finally got in and requested the pass and my sister in law was made to feel like she was lying. They asked a million questions about her disability etc. If it   s the case that someone needs to prove an actual disability, why wasn   t she told over the phone to bring some type of proof with her? However we saw many able bodied people cruising up the exit line with their wheelchairs, were the given the same treatment. Your employees really need some training about autism and how if effects each person differently. We proceeded to the rides after the 20 questions and tried to have a good day. This pass my niece was given was an awful waste of time. She had to go to a specific stand (2 in the entire park) to get one fast pass which many times it seemed the fast pass lines were longer than the regular lines. But hey if we would have spent an $90 a day we could have pre booked our fast passes(a service that is Free at Disneyworld). We ate lunch in Cafe Orleans and it was great. The waitstaff was quick to clear our plates and have friendly conversation with us. Wish all the Disneyland employees were so great! We rode a few more rides and part of our group left for a nap. Later that evening we headed to the queue for Fantasmic, we were pointed to the viewing area for people we did not get fast passes and at the entrance of this queue we asked were stroller parking was and we were told to take it with us. We were walking in dim lighting mind you and looking for a spot with a grumpy tired 3 year old jumping out of his stroller. We were distracted I will say but how many parents at Disneyland go thru the same thing every single day. While we were walking not focused on the ground which I guess we were expected to be, Shania stepped in front of my stroller and said rudely this area is for fast pass only do you have a fastpass? We told her no that someone pointed us down here for queueing of people who did not have fast passes. She told us see this line (a line of green tape on the ground that is not really noticeable) you need to stay on that side. So we found seats and sat down. Unfortunately we were near to ride Shania and another employee who talked the whole time we were waiting. We heard all about her snap chat, listened to her sing about being mixed (I   m also mixed along with my kids so this is in no way related to that), listened to her playing and joking all the while being rude to everyone that didn   t see her line. Then she felt the need to approach us again after sitting in the same spot for 20 minutes to tell us we needed to move our stroller to the back. We loved the stroller and finally the show started. The show was great and we left. The experience we had during this Disneyland trip was so awful we don   t want to return ever. I guess our family got used to the great service at Disneyworld we   re employees are nice and friendly at all times, we never see them on their phones and when they are standing around queuing people they don   t talk about irrelevant things they try to keep that Disney experience away from the outside world. The unfortunate thing is despite all the negative reviews Disneyland is getting is that nothing will change and it will continue to nosedive because the hundred of families that are having awful experiences won   t change ticket sales so they won   t change anything and will continue to raise prices and families will pay to get to experience the theory of Disneyland. I wrote this review in hopes that if people keep pointing out the awful experiences they are having then maybe these kids you are hiring will get some customer service skills instead of continuing to think that they can treat people however they choose because even if that family or person doesn   t return others will.

We could not get Fast Passes for those two people and had to delete them from our group to be able to get passes for the others.

Not to mention the walls were so tall and took up main st from start to finish, you couldn   t even see the Walt Disney statue or castle. Splash Mountain was also closed as they were doing work it. Additionally, parts of Small World and Fantasyland were closed. To be honest you could tell the whole park is going under a revamp. This is something Disney did not explain before going.

Bought the max pass in addition and ate every meal on premises. Extraordinarily expensive and low value. There were 5 rides broken throughout the Saturday Feb 10 (Snow white, Pinocchio, Star Wars, Roger Rabbit, Small World) that we know of. This causes the lines at working rides to double triple in length. Received Bonus multi fast pass on app because one of the rides was broken. Nice! But Wanted to use it at Small World and told we couldn   t because the fast pass machine was broken!! At every turn, even when Disney tried to make it right, it failed. Also, Disney won   t tell you the ENTIRE railway system on main street and castle area is 100% under construction across the park so the crowds have no where to go. There is no mention of this at time Of booking with the Disney travel agent by the way    and they charge you the same. January is typically construction time but it   s now mid Feb. Unacceptable. The staff were average at best as even said to us    we are breaking down   . Ate character breakfast at Park with Mini, made reservations, etc sat us in corner, no one cleared our plates until we were 100% done, and food was greasy and low quality. Disney will gladly take your money, treat you average and not tell you they should discount their prices because they sell something that is subpar. Their Tomorrowland is 1970   s Star Wars. The submarine ride is 1970   s 20,000 leagues under the sea now with Nemo holograms. Old. But if they were to improve something, they should invest more money in their app. We still had paper plastic tickets and none of our stay was linked to the app automatically. It should all be automated! Systems are not talking to each other and it shows. Not seamless. They are running an average operation at best and over selling it based on their reputation. Disney corporate should take note of the poor reviews on Trip Advisor. I don   t even see any comments fromDisney management on Trip Advisor explaining the situation. So, sorry, but the Disney magic is gone for me in California. My recommendation is to look for another park or another vacation location to spend your hard earned dollars.

It would be great if there were more family friendly areas seeing as it is Disneyland and really meant for families and kids. ,Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

My friend was in a wheel chair and we had no problem getting around. The Cast Members were polite and helpful to direct us where we needed to enter for some of the rides. Other than that, I highly recommend that if you go make sure that you arrive early to get through the security check line. I also recommend leaving the park by 3:00 p.m. because that is when it gets extremely busy. It is almost impossible to even walk anywhere! The wait for rides can be up to 90 minutes and, if you get a fast pass, that wait can still be up to 30 40 minutes BUT if the ride has shut down due to technical difficulties, the fast pass can be almost as long at the regular wait time.

This trip was made due to the changes due next year and the closing changing of a few things in the area so we thought we go this year rather than next. We keep up to date by a number of bloggers and online 'Disney' fanatics and were looking forward to seeing the Christmas thanks giving celebrations and decor. While the decorations didn   t disappoint the customer service and staff did. Normally the park turns over like a well oiled machine, knowing where to line up, being advised to stay one side, the staff advising of ride closures and reopens but over the 10 days we were at the parks there were so many ride lines that extended past the normal waiting areas and no staff around to let people know where to continue to form the line so people were pushing and jumping into the Q. The worst is where a families have one person line up and then when they are close to the front the whole family joins the Q. When we were waiting for both Santa and Jack & Sally there were more than 40 people that joined the Q towards the end on each occasion and we counted more than 50 for Soaring. While I understand that this is a 'guest issue' It would be nice if they would address this and maybe just a friendly reminder that you must have everyone in your party that wishes to ride in line etc.At the Matterhorn there was an older guy who looked like he was trying to be way more important that he was, switching lines all over the place telling people to move from the back of the line to the front. Not taking the single riders but instead splitting families and leaving the single riders line getting bigger and bigger. The other girl kept looking up to the control window as guest continued to question why the lines were being mixed up so badly but again none of the staff did anything. We rode the next day and they were still doing the same thing.A few times when we were served it was mid conversation with other cast members and some almost didn   t even look up. We received better customer service at Target that we did at Disneyland. If you are from overseas I wouldn   t follow the Disney style vlogs and blogs too much. Wi Fi is almost nonexistence so don   t read into the hype of the max & photo pass. The snack food they say is so delicious.. 8 10 times its actually not. When they say walk don   t run (you   ll be the only ones actually walking) yes it IS Disneyland and there are a CRAZY number of giant prams and strollers but that seems to be catered for however the number of ride on scooters    SERIOUSLY THERE ARE HUNDREDS and the drivers don   t budge it   s like they have a feeling of entitlement, we saw adults on these things constantly cutting off EVERYONE, including children and people in wheelchairs. We were asked a number of times to fill out a questionnaire but all of the questions were always 'where are you from' 'what hotel did you stay in' 'who did you travel with' yet we were asked to do the same thing at Universal and were taken upstairs and asked questions that were regarding improving our experience at the park, what we enjoyed and disliked and the interaction of staff and characters with us during our time at the park. Disney was just interested in volume and numbers. So many things on the internet are made out to be better than they actually are and unfortunately this was our experience with Disneyland over 10 days this time around. The park itself is beautiful and we are stuck between a rock and a hard place.

I was appalled and told her we wouldn't all fit, the handler  Gracie  kept insisting, I asked her if we could step out and hop in next car? she insisted we stuff inside.She was extremely rude to all of us and to push a metal bar down on my grand daughters back was not necessary... Gracie then said something rude to my 2 daughters , rolled her eyes and after we got out she sent them on into the ride, told my grand daughter and I to step back behind the yellow line and then slammed her hand down on the control panel and stopped the entire ride, and stormed off....I really couldn't believe what I was seeing. then another young woman came to handle the controls and I asked her the name of the girl who stormed off, she said she didn't know and that she was new to Disney and the ride itself. A few moments later a young man came in and several other employees and they proceeded to talk about how to get the ride running again. This young man it turns out was  Javier  the manager of the ride.We were baffled as to why the ride wasn't proceeding,My daughters called me from inside the ride and said the lights came on inside the ride with another couple in front of them wondering what happened, at least 20 minutes later the ride started again, never an apology to us having to wait, then my 2 daughters inside had to ride with all lights on and got to end of the ride and asked if they could ride again but were told to get off.Gracie, the rude girl was now at the end of the ride and threw up her hand , rolled her eyes and said something rude to my daughters again. the manger Javier was told what had happened and how we were all harassed , and said it wasn't harassement, and he brushed it off.At this time we were told to get back on the ride, my grand daughter and myself and ride through, I was disgusted by the treatment and lack there of, and never offered any explanation.Luckily after meeting my 2 daughters at end of ride, and exiting we found another Peter Pan worker , Gabby , who told us to go to the City Hall, and ask for a  Plaid  to file a complaint. she was the only ride employee who offered an apology for what had just happened...and said that not all the employees at Disney are so nice....We were extremely upset and decided to go take the train to the City Hall at the entrance as we were all exhausted, we finally arrived and had to wait in a long line to file a complaint.This was now 10:pm at night and we were so tired, we waited in the customer complaint line for over 30 min. and go inside and the young woman heard our plea, and was so scripted in her answer, saying how sorry she was this all happened and that this was not a good experience and then she offered us  fast passes' the rides , and no other compensation, We were in shock, as it was 10:30 pm at night, and the park closed in 30 min... and they were offering us fast passes... I have taken this up via email and phone call to Disneyland customer support with no offering except saying the employees would be under review and that was it...they couldn't offer any further compensation.I would think that Disney could at the mimimum offer us a return park tickets to experience another day to redeem the bad experience or offer us our money back, at the least, as the harassement we received was highly unnecessary and a 4 year old should never have a metal bar pushed down on her back.... this was her first ever Disneyland experience and one she will remember...Anyone else have a similar experience? please let me know .",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

Fortunately I had already bought the park entry tickets as the line to buy was also long. The park must have been at capacity as there was really only space to stand for each person. Even with fast passes and arriving early in the morning we managed to get only a small number of rides. 145 minute wait to ride on  its a small world  was unbelievable.

The revised Fast Pass pre booking system, along with the sheer numbers allowed through the gates on a single day have made visiting this park an endurance rather than a pleasure, the Disney site still claims that they can reserve the right to refuse admission once maximum numbers have been reached, but I dread to think how crowded it would need to be for that to happen. The old fast pass system of issuing on the day a limited number of passes for each one hour slot worked well   this one does not. Far too many FP  tickets are issued, resulting in stand by queues being hours long   some of the popular rides were filling up with FP riders, only allowing a couple of stand by riders on. Seeing queue times posted of 3 hours, on rides which aren't new, was a shock. We didn't visit on a public holiday or in school holidays, so goodness knows how bad it is on peak days. We left before the fireworks (fortunately, you could see the majority of them from our hotel) because people began securing their places for them at 7pm   they were scheduled for 9.45pm, that is how busy it gets.

When we got to the park, the app said we had to buy the max passes again. Tried to buy again and still didn't work. I phoned in and was on hold for 9 min at 9:49am and again at 10:56 for another 9 min and called again and finally got through. I was told they couldn't refund the charges on the phone and that I had to visit park guest services. This is totally unreasonable. I spent 45 min lining up and visiting guest services to explain. They were suggesting that it may be a problem with my phone or the signal. 5 other people were complaining at the same time. It seemed to be the only complaint that day. Why not just admit it's not working, sincerely apologize and offer an immediate and prompt refund. They finally refunded me after much wasted time and unnecessary discussions. The next day, Oct 23, my credit card was charged again for another $20.00 but I had deleted the app so I can't figure out how or why we were charged again? I call in today Oct 24 to complain (another 15 min on the phone, transfer to a supervisor, etc) and was told I should get a refund back in a couple weeks latest but to keep checking. A good business would extend an offer at a minimum of an instant refund (not one that takes hours of complaining and time on hold to receive). Since it took hours to conclude, Id also extend an offer a courtesy comp pass for the next visit to make up for the inconvenience. No such customer service experience with Disneyland. Walt Disney's legacy was the creation of what most humans think of as the happiest place on earth. He left that legacy in the hands of management to maintain and uphold. My opinion is that responsibility is sacred and that Disney Corp needs to consider this when making policy and procedures. Sometimes you need to let your staff be human and deal with issues as they see fit but I get the feeling staff have their hands tied or are poorly trained about customer service. I understand that certain policy is in place to prevent abuse of your system but it can be a double edge sword when a policy is too cumbersome, rigid and firm, you will end up hurting your good customers and turning your staff into subservient robots insincerely spouting canned speech language about how disingenuously sorry they are for your trouble.

220,535413385,1,2017-10,Canada,"We recently visited Disneyland on Saturday, October 7, 2017, and had a rather unfortunate experience. My husband and I were able to enjoy most of the park on a busy day (due to much strategic planning and use of the fastpass system). That was great as it was his first time, but it'll probably be our last time.A huge damper was put on our visit when we went to ride Splash Mountain. I was so excited to ride as we used one of our fastpasses and bypassed a 90 min lineup. I was worried when we were put in a boat with four other men (my husband and I are by no means tiny) but I figured we would be fine if a cast member thought it was okay for that much weight in the boat. The ride was great, we had a monumental tidal wave that thoroughly soaked us   all in good fun!What was NOT fun at all was when we got to the unloading zone the boat was too heavy to make it back up the mechanism   we were stuck just beyond the emergency exit. After about 15 mins the cast members unloaded all of the other boats but told us to stay where we were. Due to liability, the jump to make it back to the emergency exit was too big. We needed to stay where we were in order to not be escorted out of the park. The fire dept had been called and would be coming soon.More than 60 minutes later the firemen showed up, only to tell us  Sorry it took so long but someone called us and told us you didn't need us anymore . That was NOT something that you want to hear after waiting for so long to be 'rescued'.In the 60 minutes that we waited our boat was a spectacle for all the people in line. We were pointed and laughed at, photos and videos were taken. Some of the men in the boat were visibly very uncomfortable with the additional attention and requested numerous times that the lineup to be cleared from sight to stop the ridicule. Nothing was done   Cast members themselves all came to check out the situation   not to be confused with 'Check on'.At no point was there communication to us or regular updates   there was no 'are you okay' from cast members, or can we get you anything. One request made by another one of the men was just a simple plastic bag as his phone and camera had been soaked and ruined from the splash   he had to ask four times.The issue isn't that we were stuck or that we had to wait. I get it, rides break, stuff happens and it's all a part of the experience. The thing that's so upsetting is that this is DISNEY. The epitome of customer service and the place where the magic happens, NOT a place to be pointed and laughed at, underserviced, or shrugged off.I followed up with Disney customer service and received a cookie cutter canned response  we're sorry the ride broke  and  we're sorry you had bad service  cut and paste out of an employee manual.I completely understand that things happen, rides and attractions have technical difficulties. Our experience was a little beyond 'disappointment over the temporary closure of Splash Mountain', it was the fact that we WERE the temporary closure of Splash Mountain as a result of poor judgment of the staff. As such we were treated distastefully by all staff, not to mention the harassment and spectacle we endured during the wait.We had already missed the fireworks.Visiting from Canada for the weekend we only had one day in the park. I asked if we could talk to someone about the possibility of a meal voucher or gift card for the shops we were shrugged off and they told us to go to 'city hall' customer service, where I could wait again and lose the rest of our ONLY evening. We had at this point already lost almost 2 hours of our very limited time in the park.It would be nice to receive a genuine apology for myself and the other men in the boat. This is Disney... the epitome of customer service and the go to example used in all experiential marketing. I'm hoping they can make it right and restore the magic in my eyes.I would also strongly encourage a weight distribution disclaimer for your staff at Splash Mountain   rather than cramming the boats full, consideration of safety first.Disneyland is NOT what it used to be.",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

I'd been working hard, and been squeezing in places to visit on my days off, and Disneyland was a top priority. I've always loved this place, being an older adult, and having been since I was a child, my daughter was a child, we are both adults and we longed to experience the 'Happiest place on Earth' once more. I was never so disappointed.Extremely long lines, with no relief in sight except for that God awful 'Fastpass' feature. They really need to get rid of that and fast. You have to hold on to your admission ticket all day, insert it into this machine on the ride of your choice, only to have to return to it over an hour or two later to 'supposedly' get front of the line benefits. How is this 'fast' when you have to return over an hour later?You can only get one fast pass at a time, meaning no two times can overlap. So this leaves you walking around, rather aimlessly, buying things you really didn't want, just to kill some time. (Smart move Disney).It gets rather boring and tiresome walking around, waiting for a ride that's only 3 5 minutes long. We went to Toontown only to NOT see Mickey. He was apparently busy 'filming'. The line to see Minnie was wrapped around her house. Again, we found ourselves buying things we really didn't want just to fill space while waiting for our Fastpasses to kick in. So our time finally came to ride Space Mountain, yeah! We were in line, almost there when....it broke down! NOOOO!!!!!! They told us it would be an hour before anyone else could ride it...........I was soooo mad.We went to the classic ride, Pirates of the Carribbean. I was so stolked! We were in line, and (wait for it) it broke down! NOOOO!!! About 100 riders, trapped on boats. I wanted to ride it so bad my daughter and I decided to wait it out. A few people chose to leave. After about 30 minutes, yep 30, it was up and running again. We got on.All the water rides were about a two hour wait, so we passed those entirely. The Matterhorn was by far, the most bumpiest ride I've ever ridden. I don't remember it being that bumpy. The only highlight was the burger I had for lunch dinner. It was de lish! Very well done and flavorful. But overall, my experience at Disney was very lackluster. It's not what it used to be. It's become a very hip 'Tourist only' spot, that gauges into your pockets to spend wayyy more than you really should. I just didn't feel like a 'kid again' like I used to when I go. I felt like an adult, who went to an amusement park, spent a lot of money, rode half of the rides due to long wait times, and just had an average time. I bought a Mickey plush, to remember my last time going to Disneyland.If you really wanna have a good time, go to Universal Studios. Buy a 'Front of the line Pass'.

Let me also say that we are lucky enough to be a well travelled family that between us have been to theme parks all over the world at the height of Summer, (including Disney in Paris and Disney in Florida) so we have very realistic expectations of how busy these parks can be. However, nothing could have prepared us for the sheer volume of people in the first park, the original Disney Land. We knew we were coming to a smaller park and that the attractions might have seen better days, but that turned out to be fine. The staff were lovely and friendly as always, the place was clean and the rides were fine (except 'its a small world' which is a shocker and should be closed...dreadful racial stereotyping of THE WORST kind!!)We had a two day pass and spent the first day in the original park. The volume of people was obscene; you literally couldn't move. Even with the fast pass we were lined up for 45 50 minutes for some rides. We also didn't realise that the fast past system was used for some of the 'shows', so we did not see the water lights show at the original park as all the passes were gone very early in the morning and the staff were very clear that without one of the fast pass seats there would be no view. If you didn't start sitting for the parade over an hour before hand, no way you were getting a view. You were carried along by a sea of people and at times it felt really unsafe. I am sure Disney will say they manage the crowds well and that we were really safe, but it didn't feel that way. For the evening fireworks we were herded (and I mean that) into a so called viewing area   it was worse than the Jubilee line at rush hour, we were rammed in, standing room only, pressed up against others, kids crying, people getting grumpy...not the 'happiest place in the world' for sure!! (and this was a good hour before the fireworks were due to start). Then when the fireworks went off, they were all hidden behind a tree!! So top tip...if you want to watch the fireworks there, you need to be directly in front of the castle. Even a bit over to the left (as you look at the castle) and you can forget it.The issue clearly comes down to one thing...greed. There are simply too many people allowed into the park, it was awful. We went to the California park the next day and this was much closer to our previous experience of Disney, busy but manageable and all round way more enjoyable.So if you are planning to take your kids to Disney, my advice is save your money and go to Florida.

There are no helpful signs at the park entrance. When you ask people standing around chatting to each other in uniforms they get annoyed that you've interrupted their chats and tell you to go to the ticket booth. Where is the ticket booth???There are so many varieties of tickets available and strange systems of fast past etc. No information is available from Disney about how this all works. We had to spend hours beforehand reading reviews and blogs from Disney enthusiasts. Once we finally made it inside, paying a very tidy sum to do so, the place is jam packed with shops, shops and more shops! There are a few rides, but you'll spend hours and hours queuing for them.

The parking lot is a rat's maze. My niece was on crutches and it was a loooong hike to the front gate. We rented an electric wheelchair for $50. A push chair was $30. We went down to the end of Main street to where there used to be an inside restaurant on the East side. It's a breakfast buffet now. They asked if I had reservations. Ha. They seated us outside in the 95 degree sun. The food was mediocre at best. The cost for a family of 4 was $140.  Holy crap!  I blurted out. I apologized for saying a bad word to the lady running the cash register. Most of the Disney characters came to the table to say hello. But I had to chase down Minnie to get a picture. We went to the Indiana Jones ride and waited for an hour to get on it. Then we went to the Haunted house. Another hour in line in the 95 degree sun. We couldn't get our family of four into 2 cars because she can't walk very good and the cars were moving way too fast for her to negotiate. She fell into a car and my wife jumped into it with her. We got split up into 3 cars. I got in a car with 2 strangers that was meant to hold 2 people. Stopped by a vendor to get 2 pops and 2 waters. That's a quick $16. Damn! You have a choice of dehydrating or getting robbed buying drinks. I've never seen so many people crammed into such a small area as Disneyland on a Saturday. It was the same routine all day. Wait for an hour or an hour and a half in line for a 3 minute ride. Then get ripped off paying $4 for a 10 cent bottle of water or $4 for an ice cream bar. We drove 1,300 miles for that. I should have just gone to Compton to get robbed by someone who really needed the money. There isn't hardly anywhere to sit and rest. Near the end of an exhausting day was the parade. No place to sit. But you can stand way in the back (if you're lucky) for the parade. Then at night comes the parade of lights. What a mess getting crammed into a mass of humanity. The girl working crowd control said we should come back for the later parade at 10:45. She said  You only have to come 5 minutes early to get a good seat.  That's the biggest lie I've heard in a long time. Then there was the fireworks. Standing on Main street sandwiched in the mass of sweaty people wasn't a lot of fun. It was jam packed with tens of thousands of people pushing up against you. I wanted out of there to get some fresh air but couldn't move an inch. Disneyland was fun in the old days. The more they try to improve it the worse it gets. There is NO WAY I'll ever go there again.

About an hour in we decided to go to the Haunted Mansion. My cousins husband has major back difficulties, so my cousin had me stay with her husband and she and my wife went to ask how we could make it easier on her husband. They came back to us and my cousin was hot. She stated that the girl at the gate told her that even the crips must wait in the line. We went back to the gate to confront the girl but she was gone. My cousins husband decided to try and tuff out the line. A one point my cousin spotted the employee that was rude to her. The employee saw her coming and removed her name badge. They argued. She exited somewhere into the ride and disappeared. I tried to calm down my cousin, She was HOT!! Finally I thought things were going better. We were in Fantasyland were my cousin decided to get a Coke. She went to the stand where they sell Coke products, She asked if the had Coke Zero, to which the person operating the stand named Anthony said if you want Coke Zero you better find a liquor store. I gave the young man a hard time but my cousin lost it. We went to the front gates where she complained. She then took her passes, souvenirs and anything else she had that was Disney and tossed them in the trash and we left the park after only a couple of hours. We then ended up over at Knott's Berry Farm where we had a great time. A day later I wrote an email to Disneyland describing my displeasure. I received a phone call and an email while I was at work.

The service is getting worse (many dirty bathrooms, empty towel dispensers) and the wait times are getting longer. They are packing more people in to rake in those dollars, but not investing where they need to in order to keep the traditional Disney experience untarnished. More training is needed to help with crowd control and admission (I spent an hour between security and the line to get in to the park on a Monday in early May). The park tries to offset the long lines at attractions by overcrowding the rides, which just makes for a bad ride experience. On the Pirates of the Caribbean, we were stacked up bumper to bumper 5 boats deep, with boats continually crashing into each other   and this was the second week of May (not a busy time historically). The same thing was happening on all of the boat based rides. It was insane. On other rides, it was the same story, they would run additional cars that would stack up at the end of the ride while waiting to disembark. Disney was also trying out a new Star Wars churro in Tommorow Land while we were there   red and blue light saber churros. They were wildly popular immediately. And Disney actually had their employees manually tracking which color churro a customer ordered on a paper check sheet (great use of technology Disney!). This would have been fine, but the additional time it was taking for the 1 employee (yes, these were only at 1 Churro Cart with a single employee) to do this was causing additional delays to the already crazy long lines of 30 people at almost all times (not an exaggeration). Don't waste your time in this line, they taste the exact same as a normal churro (only with added coloring). Disney needs to do something to limit the amount of admissions per day (dated tickets or something of the like), learn better crowd control techniques and appropriately staff the park with well trained staff or look at a major expansion.On the plus side, they have recently added Fast Pass to the Matterhorn and the Toy Story Midway Mania, which is helping with being able to get on more rides.

After begging and pleading and offering to take it a part, he insisted he had to keep the extension of the GoPro (valued at $69.99). Given our circumstance we said we would discard it and he disassembled our device. At 4:00pm when the Mid Day Main Street Parade began we noticed another couple with a GoPro in the park with a fully extended handheld device (the same one we had). I was shocked and completely disappointed. We went through the same security and the same screening process, but somehow I had to throw away my GoPro item and they had theirs fully extended and using it!To make matters even more disappointing, I brought up the Disney website FAQ's that read:  Folding Tripods or monopod stands that can fit in a backpack are permitted.  As I showed this verbiage to the security, he said insisted no was the answer.I am complaining because the GoPro rule was not and is not enforced for every guest who enters the park.

This became a joke...all week we kept saying anytime something happened, it was 'technical difficulties'...or in the words of my nephew, due to Davy Jones...ie tentacle difficulties. The one day we only managed 2 rides after spending hours standing in lines because the rides kept breaking down  Cars, California Screamin, Grizzly Rapids, etc. Even with fast passes on some rides...would use them and then they refused to give them back when the rides broke down, even though we hadn't ridden yet. And when I questioned the cast member who I had just handed the fast past too, he was extremely rude and condensing. I told him he had ruined the day when he wouldn't give us our fast passes back to use later when the ride opened back up and he told me I was welcome. I have never seen such poor customer service in my dozen trips before. We even got stuck on one ride (monsters inc) that broke down for over 15 minutes. The one night we stayed to watch World of Color? The show stopped after 5 minutes due to technical difficulties. The night we stayed at Disneyland to watch the fireworks? Cancelled due to technical difficulties.

It's always busy but today was impossibly busy likely due to Spring Break. But if this were any other business it would be shut down for being over occupancy numbers. This is a tragedy waiting to happen. There is literally no space to walk especially as ride lines become extended and further block available walking space. God forbid someone had an emergency or some major event happened.What I truly don't understand is why they be doing repairs on some rides if they know this is the busiest time of the year. Also, they claim to raise the prices in the busy season but I'm not at all convinced this is really done to reduce crowds. If they wanted to reduce crowds that would simply put quota on ticket sales and guests entering the park. Force people to make reservations (lottery if necessary) and reduce same day ticket sales entries.The park was an overcrowded mess today. With rides closing down constantly (we had a stretch where we went to 4 rides consecutively with fast passes and each ride was closed down for repairs), lines weaving everywhere it was often very difficult to try to understand where the line actually started, long lines for food and bathrooms, etc. It was comically annoying and actually quite pathetic and I kept wondering why I had paid so much for this. It felt very overrated.Disney badly needs to stop thinking about only making money and actually try to think about providing a quality experience again and this will begin with crowd control. As far as I can tell they currently don't have any quotas or restraints on park entries and the fastpass system broke down today on multiple occasions.

321,464168746,2,2016-12,United States,"Disneyland opened the year I was born. Living in San Diego, my parents made sure Disneyland was an annual trek for our family   I remember the days of coupon books, and our station wagon glove box was full of partially used ticket books (all the A & B coupons   LOL!), and admission was around $5. You could go for the day and ride every single good ride multiple times. Once, we went on Space Mountain TEN TIMES! Nowadays, ticket prices are well in excess of $100 and you're lucky if you make it onto 3 rides. In December, we waited in line for Thunder Mountain three times. After an hour of waiting, the ride broke down. This happened twice more. Same happened on Indiana Jones. I finally complained that we had been in the park for more than five hours and had only managed to get onto one  good  ride (Star Wars) and a supervisor gave us a  front of the line  ticket to any premium attraction. After the third breakdown on Thunder Mountain, we decided to just leave the park. We went on a total of three rides. They do have a  Fast Track , but you're only allowed to use that for one attraction at a time. Seriously, Disneyland just needs to limit the number of admissions to ensure guests can at least get on some rides. Very disappointed. Only gave it two stars for the nostalgia of how great the park was when I was a child teenager young adult.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

To also find out that there were some deep California resident discounts given that increased the crowds.... greedy! And to have bathrooms dirty and even the rides be untidy.

The magic morning early entry used to be somewhat exclusive, but now it's almost as crowded as any other time. My son and I could ride a few rides for about the first 2 hours after the park opened, but after that, it was not worth standing in lines for hours to ride a couple rides. We spent a lot of time offsite eating out, and in our hotel watching movies. We would try to go back in the evening but it was really tough to do anything. I get the concept of the more paying customers the more money, but our time at Disneyland has finally come to an end. We are now looking for other things to do other than come to that park.

We travelled their Feb 19 24 and were sadly disappointed and may not return. The staff who used to be so friendly were mostly bothered by the tourists, I was shell shocked as I remember staff being so friendly and part of the magic, but now it's just like anywhere else. I especially noticed that the people working the rides seemed almost annoyed; they wouldn't smile, barely spoke to you and rushed you through like cattle. I actually was shocked when I asked the girl running the buzz light year, if they took a fast pass, she looked at me and shook her head no and then turned away. I remember the park being so friendly and happy, but not anymore, I think they need to work on their training. We paid full price for our hopper passes, and expected some of the rides to be down as its low season; but at one point, Indiana Jones, The old railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean, bobsled ride, Grizzly, Ferris wheel, Screaming California and the carousal were all down. We paid a lot for these tickets and half the rides were down, which then made the few rides with 160 minute wait, like ridiculous. The food at the park was terrible and so expensive, but on a positive note ESPN outside the parks was awesome and so was the Rain forest cafe. All in all if you go, be prepared that staff are no longer as kind and friendly, losing the magic of the park, and its becoming just like anywhere else, over priced, broken rides, with little to no customer service.

Upon arrival at the park when it first opened at 9AM until 5PM we had made attempts to go on several rides (Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Peter Pan, Star Tours, Small World, Buzz's Astro Ride, Peter Pan and the Railcar Rollercoaster). We only made it onto 2 of these rides (Peter Pan and the Railcar) in a total of 8 hours due to  rides breaking down . We had waited in line and obtained FastPasses for the rides that had them only to find ourselves in line or on the ride and having to evacuate due to the mechanical issues they were having. Having spent $1500 to make a day trip here from Canada this was far from what we had originally planned for. We finally went to CityHall and were compensated with 4 FastPasses (which technically we already had previously, and at this point in the day the lines were minimal) and $20 food voucher. Following our trip and still being dissatisfied with the experience we spoke with customer relations and they had said that we had already been heavily compensated and there is nothing more they would offer. Pretty pathetic for a company that is worth $170 billion dollars to deny a dissatisfied guest the request for FastPasses to use for their next visit (which doesn't cost Disney anything at all) to entice them to come back and attempt to rejuvenate their feelings towards their original experience. I am not sure that I will ever be back after having gone through this. Great customer service at the park for giving us the extra FastPasses and $20 food voucher but terrible customer service by guest relations on the phone call conversation following. In reference to how much of a run around it was for us, I had my iPhone tracking my steps for that day   We walked a total of 16km's due to walking around attempting to find rides that weren't broken down and went on a total of 6 rides that day and were there until the parade ended..

So for your $97 admission & $20 to park you got fewer rides and long lines   even on a low attendance day. Then there was a 5 car fire in the garage, so they closed it as well as the trams. People (myself included) were in the line waiting for a tram, and we were told trams would be at the far end of Downtown Disney. So we all walked a long distance only to be told  no trams, so walk to the garage    another LONG distance. Upon arrival at the garage Disney stall said  IT WAS CLOSED TO EVERYONE  because of the long ago extinguished fire. So, every had to stand & wait TWO HOURS until the garage re opened. If people had been told about the garage back in the park, they could have done other things while waiting for admittance to the garage, back in either park instead of standing around a lot with no seating and NO bathrooms.

We as a family have visited the park in the last 20 years probably 8 times. We try to go every 2   3 years and it has become a family tradition and something we look forward to. Over time it has become less magical and unfortunately I find myself while we are there questioning what we are doing and whether it is worth it. We just went last week and it might be our last. This was the first time we had gone at Christmas time and we knew that it would be super crowded, but I had no concept of how crowded it would and could be. We always expect crowds and are normally good at managing them and accomplishing what we need to in order to have a good experience. These crowds were unmanageable. We literally couldn't move at times. My favorite area is over by Adventureland and New Orleans Square. There were so many people and the lines for the three major rides over there were so long that they were spilling out into the walkways and made it impossible to move. You literally couldn't walk normally, you just kind of shuffled your feet as you were pressed by bodies and tried to stay with your family. Many times the mass of people would stop and not be able to move and you would have to find another route. We found ourselves going through restaurants and over chairs to get through and heaven forbid if you needed to change directions and part the red sea. Besides the rides my favorite thing about Disneyland is the atmosphere and soaking in all the wonderful details, buildings, decorations, etc. When you are in a sea of people, getting hit in the shins with strollers and getting run over by motorized scooters, the last thing you are enjoying is the atmosphere. There is nowhere to just sit down and take a break, catch your breath and look around. The areas over by New Orleans Square that you can normally sit and enjoy yourself are filled with the overflowing lines of Pirates and The Haunted Mansion. It is exhausting and it gets to the point that all you want to do is leave, but you don't want to because of all the money you spent. You shouldn't feel physically violated after a day at Disneyland. It has lost the charm for me and isn't worth it any more. Obviously it is popular and people want to go there, but there needs to be a limit where it doesn't ruin the experience for the visitors that are there. The rides are cool, but there is a line that you cross when the ride isn't enjoyable any more because of how long you had to wait. The wait time for the Radiator Springs Racers ride was 240 minutes. Yes the ride is cool, but it is 4 minutes long and no ride is worth waiting 4 hours. You could watch 2 movies. I just don't know if it is worth it any more which is sad because I love Disneyland. The return is not worth the cost and hassle. Disney is letting their fans down for the almighty dollar. They need to limit the crowds so that those that are in the park can have an enjoyable time. It gets worse every time I go and it is out of control at this point. It took over an hour each day just to park and get in the park. If we ever go again we will look for a less busy time than Christmas, but from what I read that may not exist. Disney needs to build a new park in Texas or somewhere else or limit their crowds and put their customers' enjoyment first.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

However, Disneyland has 1 major flaw, which becomes quite evident in the first 2 hours there. Disneyland has a severe shortage of restrooms. It is baffling that a company as sophisticated as Disneyland did not account for sufficient restroom capacity inside its iconic park! For men, it's better.

No place has ever reached my heart the way this magical place has. With much to my despair I'll have to disclose the following. I have been to all the Disney parks around the world except for the ones in China. Disneyland CA although the original, is slipping dramatically in regards to customer service, crowd control, and overall appearance. I believe a lot has to do with the multitude of crowds being packed into a small acreage of land. But my biggest disappointment on my last visit in Nov. 2016 was definitely with the customer service. It could be that Disneyland CA may have limited options available when hiring adequate personnel but it obviously seems that the employees  cast members  are not happy working at what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth. It breaks my heart to say this. I always put Disneyland at the top when it came to the friendliness of it's  cast members . Unfortunately that is not the case anymore. My last visit I found many of the cast members rude, unpleasant, and overall uncaring about delivering the Disney brand. Now with that being said I'll also have to add that a lot of the guests there were not very pleasant either. This sense of entitlement that everyone seemed to have staggered me.The upkeep of the park was below par. Hopefully the new expansion of the Star Wars land will allow more room for the multitude of people who visit. Or it could possibly make matters worse. I'm crossing my fingers that things will turn around for Disneyland CA. NOTE TO GUESTS: Remember when you go to Disneyland you're there to have fun. Not to act like you own the park.

I remember a time when the guest service agents smiled and said hello, this time it was very obvious the staff were unhappy, I even heard a conversation between two disgruntled employees.

Other cast members actually challenged us and said no it wasn't and swiped it about 15 times then tried the plastic bag method. My concern came when the card was actually getting bent as this was unfortunately the only card we had brought with us. The cashier at the pin store called for a manager and they came and tried another pos machine. She swipes it a dozen or more times while telling us that of course it would work. Then loudly announces it was declined. I have a minor heart attack at this as I was monitoring our spending and we were no where near our limit.

The park layout was a mess it was every man for him self once you payed for the ticket. when you walked in it was easy to get turned around and with a lack of signs it was easy to walk right by and miss the rides .. 3.

Could not get on The Tower of Terror due to120 mins line which was fairly consistent for the whole day. Oh I almost forgot if you are driving add another $18 for parking.

This is classic double dipping! Park hoppers paid full price for a day, but got kicked out 5hours early, and the trick or treaters, paid $50 for half day, I guess we'll be going to Universal or Magic mountain from now on.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

The park had to at least be approaching that mark as it was a near un sail able Sea of people. The fast passes were gone by early afternoon and in short a highly anticipated vacation turned into my wife and I just trying to navigate a park that I knew I would never be back to. My son (and all three of us) enjoyed the rides we did get onto, and if you can hit the park at a quieter time I would recommend it.But do your homework   we were there for the first week of October and found out while there that Arizona students have a funky school year and that they were on a 2 week break (I'm from Canada and wouldn't have guessed in a million years that that could be a problem). Also discouraging was that I did ask 3 different staff members at Disneyland and they said that what I was seeing is normal... I hope not, as I honestly wasn't seeing a lot of smiles on people's faces.Conclusion: I loved the rides, but I hate insane crouds. If you go during a busy time you are basically paying $1000 for the 'pleasure' of being in lineups.PSDivide their 80000 people capacity by the number of actual rides..

We managed to go on 5 not very funny rides in the six hours within the park. The rest of the time we spent getting back and forth to the parking lot, even though the shuttles ran frequently. We had two meals. No details but we finished them mostly because we were hungry. Positive:We wathed a 15 minutes show that was good fun and I liked the shapes and designs of some of the rides(the monorail and the old futuristic tomorrowland).

We looked at what rides were closed and decided to go and take the kids out of school. It was busy. very busy. If this is considered not busy    then my point is made for me. Long lines. Long waits. I think it has to do with so so many season passes. Almost everyone paying for meals and merchandise had a season pass card to get their discount. I understand economics. Disney just doesn't care about the experience as long as they are full. But for me, I just don't think we can do it anymore and fight with the wall to wall traffic. On top of that we made sure that splash mountain was suppose to be open .. then on day 3    we go over to that area    big sign up the area is closed. So we ask the person standing there    for how long? A month!!! We were not the only people complaining. On top of that I have never in my other 7 times experienced the high level of break downs!! Thunder mountain many times. Space mountain also. Even some of the smaller rides like Snow white was down for periods of time. With all the extra season pass money you think they could pay for some maintenance so things would stay up. A once great place is now just run to maximize profits.

398,417140642,1,2016-9,United States,"There is a good reason why the commercials on The Disney Junior Channel show Walt Disney World and not Disneyland.This review is for both the Disneyland Park as well as the Disney California Adventure Park. I couldn't discern one park from the other. We had the same lame overpriced experience in both parks.Some people that are part of the Disney cult (that is the ones wearing the overpriced Mickey Mouse Ears and t shirts) that will probably be appalled by this review. But I can honestly say that I absolutely couldn't wait to leave the park each day (on a 2 day ticket). If I was given free tickets and vacation time to visit the park I wouldn't go back.The best way to describe the park is: 1. start with Disney World 2. shrink it to a fraction of the size 3. add more people and fewer attractions 4. add a fair number of homeless people outide the gate5. charge more for the same quality hotels.It's a great experience if you want to wait an hour and half in the Mickey Mouse house to see Mickey for 1 minute. There was absolutely no indication outside the Mickey Mouse house of how long the wait would be (when there were indications of the length of the queue they were way off). We waited in line about 30 minutes for a 3 minute kiddie train ride. Even the caurosel had a 10 minute wait. There was a 40 minute wait to be seated in overpriced cafe   so my family opted for 2 lemonades, 2 pretzels, and a hotdog for $29.  They do offer the 'Fast Pass' which is a good option for the more popular attractions. Unfortunately, this option is not available for most of the toddler attractions.This was my first (and last) trip to Disneyland. Because I've been to Disney World in Orlando many times the comparisons are inevitable.I'm not a Disney person. I first went to Walt Disney World in Orlando in peak season(as part of a sports team visiting the area) when I was 17 and I didn't understand all the fuss. I preferred Busch Gardens, Six Flags and (what were then) local places like Hershey Park. I'd give the Magic Kindom a B . Epcot was more to my liking   probably a B  and I'd give MGM studios a B. BTW   I had a better experience at Universal Studios versus any of the Disney Parks. Over the years, I've been back to Walt Disney World for conferences and such. I like it but don't love it. However, it's superior to Disneyland.On top of it all, Disneyland is a total rip off. $568 for a 2 day pass for 2 adults and 1 child (and that wasn't a park hopper pass with AAA discount). Once you add the price of the hotel for 3 days (about $900 with tax) the 2 days at Disney costs $1500 (prior to food and transportation). BTW   the Marriott Hotel was actually the best part of the stay.A good family vacation? Standing in line for 30 minutes for a 1.5 3.0 minute ride?Not for us. Yosemite is a good family vacation. Sequoia is a good family vacation. Hawaii is a good family vacation.Sitting in traffic is preferable to Disneyland. In either case, not much is happening most of the day. At least when I'm sitting in traffic I have air conditioning and music.Fortunately, we went to Catalina Island after Disney. We spent much less money. We ate better food.

Sure, it was decades ago, but I remember having the distinct feeling of  Oh, we are in Fantasy Land now, and here we are in Jungle Land, etc. But Disneyland has lost its charm or ability to give you that experience of magical environments. This visit was midsummer, so perhaps a rainy day would give a better experience. But over all, Disneyland is just an outrageously expensive buzzkill. BTDT   got the t shirt.

For the shows, some people of the audience standing in front put their kids on their shoulders blocking the views of others! People were even allowed to save seats before some of the shows began up to a certain time. The way the crowds were let into the cinemas also leave a lot to be desired. In Tokyo, the audience is guided into the cinema and led to the seats row by row, filling up every seat beginning from the middle of the aisle. This didn't happen here and the crowds were left to fill up seats on their own with gaps in between seats.Generally the staff were only average.

We tell her that my son is turning 3 today so she tells us we have to pay full price for him. I tried to be nice and even funny but no dice. This woman has worked here since the day Disney opened, and she likely gave birth to Walt Disney himself. She's seen it all and she doesn't care. So I bought 3 tickets, went to a different counter changed my story and got my son in for free. I had warned my kids of the lineups and I made sure I took snacks and water and anything that I could possibly hold on my back. I downloaded the app to tell me wait times attractions etc. It didn't help. We went on about 4 rides and waited in line to meet Mickey, rapunzel and goofy, and then we stopped for lunch. At that point my six year old made an executive decision to go back to the hotel and play in the pool. So we cut our losses and left. Later that night we went back but still, it wasn't for us.

Long, long waits for rides, not wholly unexpected and worst of all, crowding is worse than ever. So, when friends heard my not so great musings on Disneyland, they were bound and determined that I should try it again. Well, it was actually worse. Even MORE crowded, if this was even possible. There still seems to be absolutely no crowd control and fine, I'm used to waits for the rides but, waits to even move in the park? Just shuffle along slowly and push people out of the way? The last time, it was a disappointing  last time  for my mom to see the park but, this time, the kids were tired of it after 5 hours and couldn't wait to get out. We adults decided to deal with it but, the KIDS wanted out! To be clear, we also took them to Knotts Berry Farm and Legoland, which they loved. Though also crowded, the crowd control seemed more organized. I doubt that Disneyland even bothers to close the doors for past capacity crowds. It's all about the $, apparently. I am so glad that I have fond memories of this place from years ago. I certainly don't now. No need to ever go back. On the plus side, my friends insisted that they pay as a  treat .

One week ago, I recommended my friends to drive to California to go to Disneyland. We drove more than 1,100 miles to reach to California disneyland in Anaheim, 50 minutes south of LA . It was nothing like my experience in Paris. In a very ridiculous way they make money out of people. They divided fun rides into different parks to make people pay for more than one ticket. The ticket for the one park is $105 for one day and the interesting part is that you can not even enjoy the limited rides because they sell thousands of thickets which is hundred times more than their capacity. People are all going around in the park instead of having fun. You have to wait approximately 2 hours for each ride on a week day. I can not imagine how it would be on weekends or holidays. Personnel and selling people are grumpy and obviously are not willing to answer people questions. I have no idea how is the disneyword in Orlando but for sure disneyland in california does not worth to try. It's not OK that they makes crazy lines of people who are suffering from pain in their legs because of too much standing in the lines to get a 3 minutes ride! Even it's not that much hard to fix the situation, at least they could sell thickets according to their capacity or they could put something that people can sit on when they have to wait hours in the lines. I understand families go there because they want their kids happy, but I really think it's the time to boycott California disneyland until they make some improvements in their services.

During our visit in early May, 2016, many of the attractions rides were closed for refurbishing or updating. I understand these things need maintenance and a fresh coat of paint from time to time, but in consideration of so many attractions rides being shut down, Disney should have knocked a considerable amount off their admission price. There was no discount given for entering a park with many attractions rides unavailable. I would expect that attitude from a 3rd rate park, but Disney used to have a reputation for being family friendly.The park has an odor problem as well. Almost everyplace we stopped to rest had a distinct sewage odor to it. That really takes the magic out of the Magic Kingdom.I purchased what was allegedly coffee from a cart near the castle.

I know, I should have returned it for a refund, but I was concerned about what I might say to the young lady about the quality of the sewage she was selling as coffee.The lust for our money is more evident at Disney than it has ever been.

This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30 45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the  Rollicking Roadsters  at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on  line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the  Disney Magic , you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the  Happiest Place on Earth , but that seems to be long in the past.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

Over three days we were only able to ride 9 rides due to the above mentioned conditions. Many of the operational rides appeared to be in poor condition as well; dirty, chipped paint and cracked plastic.Although we encountered some friendly cast members, many of the staff members were abrasive and it was hard to find the 'good customer service' we have become accustomed to while visiting this park. The stench (? raw sewage) coming from the castle area was overwhelming for all three days of our visit. Every morning we stood in line waiting to get into the park with smiles on our faces in anticipation of reliving past fabulous experiences in Disneyland.

However, it was so crowded yesterday, you couldn't tell where the lines for the rides were, and walking was nearly impossible! In fact, we relished waiting in long lines, because it gave relief from the pushing, shoving, and getting the backs of your ankles run over by strollers! In eight hours, we were able to get on two rides. The part that will keep us from ever going back, though, was at the end of the day. We had a train to catch, and needed to exit the park to catch a shuttle to the train station at 2130 hours. We left the souvenir shop closest to the gate, no more than 75 yards, at 2100 hours.....it took us OVER ONE HOUR to get out of the gate. There was zero crowd control, and literally no way to move. Had there been a fire or some other emergency, there would have been casualties. BTW: we missed our shuttle.Does Disney not keep track of how many people are in the park? Can they not see the streets are so crowded you cannot move? I would advise folks to avoid this place, or be ready to shuffle, jostle, push, shove, be run over, stepped on, walked on, stepped on, and hoping the lines for the rides are long just so you can get a respite from the crowded streets!There were literally children crying and saying they wanted to go home.

We headed back and opted for the less popular younger rides, we got to the front of Roger Rabbit after 30 mins, but it got closed temporarily due to a problem, so we went through to a small world but the wait was over an hour, so onto the carousel, but it got closed as we joined the queue, across the way we joined the queue to something else, but this got closed too! by this point the kids were getting upset we had been in the park over two hours and been on one ride.It was a hot day so we said never mind lets have an ice cream, we ordered four but Enrique must have miss heard me and gave us three, one which we did not want, I apologised an asked for it to be changed and another added, and for the first time in all my experience of Disney an employee was rude to me, criticising me for changing my order, which I had not done.

We went back to the hotel had a swim and some food and returned later on, to try again, but by this point the queues were still long and other things had closed, albeit temporarily, this time it was the haunted house, the queue to see mickey and minnie were still 60 minutes, and even with the fast passes we were all quickly loosing the will to continue.

And we didn't even try to go on rides that were popular, those wait times were rediculous. One of the very few positives about Disneyland are the characters and getting pictures with your child with those characters. Each day there are times and locations of where those pictures can be obtained. However, the character are rarely there and they are never there at the times that they say they will be. If you see a character and want a picture, sprint to try and get in line. Odds are that if you see the character when they first come out, you will get a picture. If however, you see the character already in he process of taking pictures, the line has already been cut off and you won't get a picture. Simply put, the character pictures are a huge part of the appeal for my son, he loves the Disney characters, but we can't get him a picture because of the reasons listed above. There are too few characters on a whole and their limited availability makes the issue much worse. I do understand the issue of someone having to dress up in a costume and that it's not pleasant, I support them not being in those costumes for extended periods of time. I'm just saying, get some more people to play those roles so that people can actually get pictures with them.Disneyland park is severely outdated and has ridiculous wait times. California adventure is more wide open but is limited in their offerings to young children. For a 2 1 2 year old, you can do the whole park in less than 2 hours, there just isn't a lot available to them. My son loved the Disney Jr. Show, I highly recommend it for parents of children that like doc mcstuffins, Sofia the first and the Mickie mouse club house shows.

We spent most of the day waiting in lines, and managed to get on only 7 rides over the course of 10 hours. Most of the rides were fairly disappointing, tending to be more jerky than thrilling. Space Mountain and Indiana Jones were two of the better ones, although neither was as much fun as an average roller coaster at most amusement parks. We visited Disney on a weekday, thinking the park would be less crowded, but the lines were regularly an hour or more long. The rides are not very reliable either, as both Space Mountain and Indiana Jones were unexpectedly shut down WHILE we were waiting in line. We left the line to ask for a FastPass to come back later, but the Disney staff would not issue these when the ride was down, saying this was the  policy . They told us we could either remain in line indefinitely, or return later and start at the back of the line again. We decided on the latter as no one could tell us when these rides would be operational again. In total, we waited over THREE hours in line just for those two rides. Unlike Universal Studios, which has a  Front of the Line  pass that you can purchase in advance and use on every ride, Disney has a  FastPass  system which is an absolute joke. These FastPasses are issued for one ride at a time, are not issued in a central location so you have to go to each ride to get one, cannot be acquired quickly (limits are roughly one per hour), and are issued for a ride several hours later in the day. We had two that were issued for after 10pm. I'm not sure which families are staying that late at an amusement park, but it certainly is not us. But hey, at least the FastPasses are free!The staff we encountered during our visit were not very friendly and only occasionally helpful.

First, the entry. One morning, we got there at 8 and we're stuck in lines, waiting to get in, until 9. We wasted an our just trying to get into the park. Wr learned our lesson and slept in for the rest of our trip. All of the lines were so incredibly long, and it could have been solved by simply opening more entry stations. It's almost as if they want people to be miserably waiting in line because after you gain entry, that's pretty much all you do. Lines for rides were AT LEAST 30 minutes long. The majority are much longer. Second, the amount of strollers being pushed through the park is INSANE. I don't know how many times I was tripped and run into. It was horrifying. It's only compounded by the number of people inside the park. It's absolute mayhem. The whole experience feels like Disney was sucking money and life out of us.

The workers seemed nice I really didnt interact with them that much except to ask where certain rides were and they were helpful. It did start to get crowded around 7pm and im guessing because the locals got out of work school. The one thing that made me hate disneyLAND was the paint the night parade. Not the parade itself that was simply phenomenal but how they allow the crowds to gather towards the end and follow mickey, let me tell you that you CANNOT walk through the crowd to leave the park. Some idiot actually tried to trample my stroller because we were trying to leave and were walking in the opposite direction. It was so unsafe it was scary I had to bring out the  New York  in me and push him then yell for everyone to get the F out of the way so me and my kids can get through.

Disneyland in California has been ruined by horrible overcrowding due the overselling of their annual passes. This place is no longer for tourists who might want to enjoy the old Disney magic once or twice a year. It's for the pass holders who want go to the park once or twice a week all year long. About 20 or 30 million people live within a two hour drive of this park and a large percentage of them have season passes. You would think that with all the recreational and entertainment options in Southern California these people would have something better to do than go to Disney once a week to stand in hour long lines to go on the same ride for the 1,000th time. You would be wrong.You used to be able to go this place during the week on a school day and it wouldn't be horribly overcrowded. Not anymore. Here's a rundown of the wait times I encountered today on a Tuesday in February (school day) after I was suckered into buying a three day ticket recently with the SoCal discount. Arrived at the entrance gate 75 minutes before the so called  magic hour  as recommended on their website (hotel guests and 3 day or more ticket holders get in an hour before regular opening time on certain days.) At 7:45 AM the line for every single entrance gate is already 200 plus people long. Takes 25 minutes just to get in the front gate with pre printed tickets. So 10 minutes of the not so magic hour already gone.Go to recently renamed Hyper Space Mountain (basically same ride with a few new sound effects) and the line was already 15 minutes. Note that this is still 45 minutes before the park officially opens for the day. Turns out that would be as good as it gets all day. The next ride is Star Tours, line is already 30 minutes. Keep in mind this is still 30 minutes before the park even officially opens. So 2 rides and the  magic hour  is gone. Now it's 9:10 and I immediately fast pass Space Mountain since I'm right next to it and the fast pass system opened 10 minutes ago. Reserved ride time is 11:50 AM. It's already a three hour wait for fastpass and the park officially opened ten minutes ago. I weep for the suckers who bought a one day ticket for 100 bucks and are still waiting in the line to get in at what they thought was the park opening.Next up, Matterhorn Bobsled ride at 9:15 AM. Wait time 40 minutes. It's now 10. Next ride, Indiana Jones. 45 minute wait time. It's now 11. Get lunch at Pizza port for me and my wife for 30 bucks and walk around the new Space Port exhibit to kill time for my fast pass return at Space Mountain. Hmm, you can buy a Darth Vader costume for 4 grand or a storm trooper outfit for 2 grand. No, I'm not kidding. Not surprisingly 3 cashiers sit around looking bored as nobody is buying their overpriced junk. After having a few laughs at how ridiculous Disney has become I go back for my one fast pass ride. I'm done for the day at noon. By 11 AM Disneyland was so horribly overcrowded it was like a zombie horror film with the undead wandering the narrow paths menacingly. Strollers shoved into wheelchairs who knocked over old people on walkers, who were then trampled by the stampeding hoards wearing mouse ears. Every once in a while a speeding scooter would flatten out the fallen. I can still remember a day about 7 years ago when I went here midweek in September after Labor Day and every ride had no longer than a ten minute wait. Thanks to corporate greed and the annual pass system those days are long, long gone. Do yourself a favor and stay away until the annual passes are discontinued.

We visited during the week, in February, because we read that the crowds are smallest at this time. While this may be true, the place is still the busiest place I've ever been, except for India. No, seriously, By the weekend, there was a soul destroying lineup to simply get through security, just so that you could get into the life sucking lineup to actually get into the park so that you could cram yourself through the mortifying crowds to line up for EVERY SINGLE thing. Kids were crying, melting down everywhere, parents were trying to pretend they were happy that they spent $100 each to do this, and on that last morning, I felt only dread and actual horror at the prospect of going in. Thank god for California Adventure Park, shining like an oasis on the opposite side. Once through the security line, we surveyed the gross, gross line to Disneyyland and our 6 and 8 year olds both said  I'm not goin' in THAT! , so we headed across the way to California Adventure, with no line to get in whatsoever. While the attractions are pretty amazing, both parks have the same thing going on to control the crowds outside each one   wrap the line, accordion style, in and out of walls that will both hide the hideous lineup from view, and keep it tightly controlled so as not to block the walkways though Disneyland. I understand this, but thought it was also pretty deceptive, because honestly, one look at the ACTUAL lineup for those attractions in its full glory would make you turn and run for the hills! While I appreciate the quality of the attractions, I just am not happy to wait minimum 20 minutes for each one. The most popular can be 90 minutes plus waiting time. California Adventure was better on this front as we seemed to breeze in and out of most things, but I truly think that was blind luck, right time, right place. By breeze in and out, I mean  wait only 5 15 minutes per attraction , btw. People rave about Fast Passes, but for the 5 or 6 attractions that actually give them in each park, letting you rapidly enter between appointed times, you can only hold a couple at once, so you certainly can't rely on this method all day long. When we wanted lunch, even the restaurants had 40 minute waits. And that was at 11:00! I get that you can  strategize  your day to  maximize  your time. But when I'm on vacation, no thanks. FACT: no matter what, you're going to spend 90% of your day walking from lineup to lineup, and waiting in line. This was my assumption going in, but no one who has been said it out loud.

Our family all agreed after a very long terrible experience at Disneyland that this is one of the poorest theme parks we have even attend. Don't waste your time and money here and here are a few reasons why.1. Get their early and you will still park up high and even further away,,, which makes no sense. 2. Crowds were terrible! Don't believe the Crowd tracker sites!! Doesn't help most half the kiddie rides were closed,,, and yes Disneyland has only Kiddie rides. Not even some good ones for the big kids to enjoy like at Disney World. 3. Oh and again more than half the rides were closed and not worth the $$$$$. The only reason we were there so long was because of the lines. 4. None of the rides were as good or better than any other theme park we have been too. Our kids had more fun at Santa Monica Pier where they sale all ride bracelets for $30.00. 5. Safety violations everywhere and won't even go into that.6. Did not see one character in real life all day!!7. the employee did not exhibit the Happy work attitude you would expect. 8. Food was okay & that is where they make a lot of money.9. Got herded around like cattle because they were making a movie so we the paying customers weren't important enough to care about at that point. We were herded out like cattle though a 20 ft area, major fire hazard. 10. since so many rides were shut down they gave a fireworks show (which they should not matter what) 11.

On Main Street you get Pretzels, New Orleans area has cold Salad, if you are by the Splash mountain and hungry you get fries. There are very few decent veggie meal options and long walks to get to any of those decent options: Veggie skewers at Adventure Land at Bengal Barbecue, cold sandwich at tomorrow land, cheesy pizza at tomorrow land, and burger at fantasyland. Veggie skewers are hit or miss, some of the veggies were not grilled fully and were half baked.

It was my daughter's birthday, so I decided to treat her to Disneyland as she has wished. I didn't mind the extra wait at the front gate to be searched and to go through the metal detector. After all, we are living in different times. But I knew it was a bad sign when after waiting 60 minutes in line for Hyper Space Mountain, we were told that the ride has broken down. By that time, even the Fast Pass has run out. They simply let way too many people into the park. It was so crowded that we kept bumping into people and being run over by strollers and scooters everywhere we went. The lines for all the rides were 60 minutes long in average, and the more popular ones were 90 to 120 minutes long. To sum it up, we were only able to get on 4 rides the whole day. For $99 per person, that was ridiculous! I don't think it was what Walt Disney had envisioned when he opened the park. People were being herded like cattle throughout the day whenever there was a parade. Then it began to rain, we were soaked and sought shelter under the awnings at the Main Street to dry up a little. But the  cast members  kept yelling at us and the others to keep moving. I tried to explain to them that the children were wet and we would like to stay out of the rain for a little while. The cast members were unsympathetic and insisted that we move. I asked for a supervisor and they threatened us with security. So we left the park. To make matters worse, there were lines waiting for the tram to take us back to the parking structure. We waited for at least 30 minutes and had to sit in seats that were filled with puddles of water. I thought the hospitality at anything Disney was first class. They even host classes for corporations to teach them about customer service. But I feel that they had become too greedy and let too many people into the park. They didn't know how to maintain the level of customer service they are renowned for when the weather changed. It was definitely not the happiest place on earth for me, my daughter and her best friend. For the amount of money we spent, we could have gotten better entertainment and treatment elsewhere.

The drive is a good bit out of LA. We arrived at a badly organised ramp into an underground car park and didn't move for 50 mins. It took us almost 2 hours to park. The shuttle to the park took 40 mins to arrive. Thinking that once we were in it would get better boy were we wrong. Starbucks queue was 40 mins to get a coffee I waited 1 hour to get on a slow mountain ride we tried to get fast passes for some of the bigger rides but the time was 4 hours away. I watched kids stand in line for 90 mins and they were crying in the line. We tried walking around the park just to experience it but the crowds were so big that we couldn't see anything.

Now you need to go to a kiosk and request a ride. They scan your ticket and tell you when to show up at that attraction. Wait times can be as long as an hour. In the meantime, you cannot ride any other rides as your ticket is locked into the one you requested. If you stand in the line you can, but if you are in a wheelchair or a scooter and try to access handicap line they tell you that you have to wait until your first ride is finished..so for that hour, you are pretty much sitting there waiting. One day at Disneyland and we were able to ride 4 rides. The second day we hired a V.I.P for $400.00 an hour. Yep, you heard me right. $400.00 an hour. And you have to have a minimum of 6 hours. $2400.00 for my family to be able to ride more than 4 rides. Two of the rides we went on were 45 minute waits even with the VIP guide. And both of those rides closed down just as we we getting to the front of the line. Two hours wasted. We were refunded one hour, so at least we weren't that upset. I don't advise a VIP guide, as nothing about it made my family feel Very Important. No bottle of water, munchies or even straight to the front of the line. In fact..WE bought our guide lunch. So..sorry Disneyland. This family that has come every year for the last 20 years, will NO longer be patrons. Until you change your handicap policy, for the better and not for the worse, my money will be spent elsewhere. You might have shut down the scammers, but you made it impossible for those that truly need the handicap services to enjoy your park.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

The other parts open at 9AM when there is the second running of the strollers. I can not imagine if they had to evacuate the park in an emergency what would happen.

There are rope lines set up to help with lines into the rides and handing out candy. With the crowds as huge as when we went, we watched as people were blocked off by massive crowds on one side and no way to get out due to the crazy rope lines on the other, people started to panic down by the haunted mansion area, going under the rope lines to escape and only to get berated by park employees for  cutting in line  , ridiculous! It took 45 minutes to get a bag of popcorn, the soda we waited 15 minutes to buy ran out of syrup. We had dinner at the Blue Bayou and had to wait a half an hour beyond our reservation time. The Pirates ride, Thunder Mountain AND Indian Jones ALL broke down at the same time in the same area of the park, that did not help with crown control AT ALL. The young people working in the park are simply not trained to handle crowds like this either. Customer service overall slips, as everyone appears to fall into survival mode including employees. It was crazy, we left early. Conversely, we have had a GREAT time at the Halloween party in WALT DISNEY WORLD.We all came away thinking this park is too small for these size crowds, and that the customer service in general was not even close to being on par with what we have always received in Florida.

It certainly was eye opening...First of all   we got 2 day park hopper tickets and because they were 2 day we ALL had to have our picture taken. WHY? Well, the cast member recited his lines perfectly about how it was to  protect  us in case we lost our tickets and someone else tried to use them.  Really , I said    so if we lose our tickets do you invalidate them and issue new ones? .  No.  This conversation went around in circles for about 2 minutes until I finally got him to admit that the REAL reason they MUST take your picture is to make sure you don't give sell your ticket to someone else. Nice.... BTW   you HAVE NO CHOICE. You MUST have your picture taken or they will not allow you in. Each person is linked to a ticket   yes, EVEN THE KIDS. And when you re enter, be sure you have the right person with the right ticket or you won't get in.Lines were outrageous and people working were crabby and generally unfriendly.Indiana Jones ride broke twice in the same day. Space Mountain also broke down. Tomorrowland future building is closed for a year to renovate it.FASTPASS tickets were a joke   more so, if you get a FASTPASS for certain rides you cannot get one for a different ride until you actually USE the first one.... such as Space Mtn and the Star Wars 3D ride.I guess the most upsetting thing was how DIRTY the park was. We have been here 4 times over the past 8 years and it has NEVER been dirty. NEVER. There were always people cleaning with rags, sweeping, etc. There were papers, food, gum, all kinds of things ALL OVER THE PARK and we only saw ONE person in the two days we were there that was sweeping. Very disappointing. Walt would be ashamed.We were travelling with grandparents in their 70s and at one point they just could not walk anymore. They showed their handicapped state issues cards to access the Haunted Mansion and it took 2 people to come over and be both rude and uncompassionate to tell them they had to walk ALL THE WAY back to the front to the main building to get a pass. They issues a FASTPASS and said to return in an hour   but it was apparently a big inconvenience for them.The next day they went directly to the Main Building to get a  pass . They were told that unless they rented a wheel chair they could not be assisted. More so, they were told by a cast member that it was a  park and you should expect to walk around a lot and wait on line if you are here . Nice. Very nice. Luckily we were with them and the grandkids had us to run around with them. But tell me, does this mean that grandparents are no longer welcome into Disneyland with their grandchildren unless the kids (regardless of age) push the grandparents around in wheel chairs? Completely unacceptable. I do realize that people abused the privilege and were hiring people to go to Disneyland with them to get line passes, but please.... these people are in their mid70s.... this wasn't a joke. Shame on Disney.I guess like all things, it has become completely and totally commercialized and the care and interest in making it a fun, family friendly, clean experience has passed.

561,323658858,2,2015-10,United States,"So...the last time I came to Disneyland Park was nearly 20 years ago and have fond memories of the place. Much has changed since then and I decided to come again the day before Halloween, perhaps that was my biggest mistake. We arrived at 1PM and it was unbelievably crowded, judging from the research I've done after the visit, I guess this Park attracts more locals and it seemed that way. Wait times were at least 40   50 minutes all around and Fast Passes were 5 hours   and desperate to just get out of one area, we decided to brave a 50 minute wait for a specific ride (Indie Jones).Now, granted the line does move so you're not really standing still for a long period of time. That I have to give them credit for doing a good job.So the above mentioned are things neither I nor Disney have much control over (apart from when I choose to visit). Here is what I was disappointed about:1) I understand that rides get updated but there were a couple of updates that detracted from the rides   Indiana Jones   I remember there used to be a boulder rolling towards us in the end and the train would seem to hurtle towards it before dropping and that was the end of the ride. Now, no boulder but you still have Indie hanging from up there and I didn't understand a word he said. Very anti climactic.2) Haunted Mansion has gone completely Tim Burton's Nightmare before Christmas now and towards the end there used to be a holographic mirror you went by and there would be a ghoul or grizzly seated beside you, now I had a roll of Christmas wrapping paper? Someone else had Dr. Zeuss' hat? What?!3) The employees were SOUR!! Whatever happened to the Happiest Place on Earth? You'd think they were working in the Most Miserable Place on Earth. They were not of good cheer, friendly, they were chatting amongst themselves and herding cattle.4) Speaking of herding cattle, hey at least entertain us while we're waiting in line especially when the waits get pretty up there like 50, 75, 80 minutes long. A person or two coming out to entertain or talk to us in character of the ride would work? I think Club Med does a better job at that...I kinda feel like I dealt with a bad pimp during my visit   they took my money, under delivered, and didn't care about my experience. Now, I've never been to a pimp, but I'm just saying'...We did have reservations at the Blue Bayou for lunch and that was good. No complaints there.But after 6 hours we still had not finished our rides in Adventureland and Critter Country and the riff raft was ballooning, I threw in the towel and headed back to the hotel for a glass of champagne instead.Maybe I'll try again on a rainy weekday in January away from any holidays or events...",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

563,323334108,1,2015-10,Canada,"I thought long and hard on my title, and as have yet, not written poor review for anything, let alone terrible. I just can't believe how little customer service there is, how poor the environment and atmosphere is, and that there appears to be no control over the volume of customers (yes customers Disney!!!) who are allowed into the park. That said, my review is not because today (our second day) a Friday, felt so horrendously claustrophobic and inhibiting for our 4 year old that we left after only 2 hours; 1 hour of which was spent queuing for a ride (auto something) that was an archaic pitiful attempt at entertainment, that goes nowhere, does nothing interesting, and ends with disappointed kids, taunted by the prospect of queuing for 80 minutes to get on the Finding Nemo submarine ride. The crowding is so bad it makes you feel very uncomfortable, unable to move anywhere without being pushed or shoved. If you have children who use a buggy (we have 2 kids one of whom does), then maybe wait until their old enough to not....its just a nightmare...you can't go anywhere with the buggy, even the monorail makes you fold it to use. I was quite surprised by the number of adults in the park without kids, but hey, its for everyone, I get that, but there really is quite a dominating feel to the park by groups of 'big kids' (read grown adults behaving like kids) who can make for an unpleasant environment. Major Point 1: Mickeys Halloween party   Saved by the Light Parade and Fireworks which are spectacular, and the only thing that makes the price of entry worthwhile. Dear Disney, great work on the lights, theme music and all that, but holy crap, the place is full of grown ups dressed up, barging around the place with bags full of candy. It was the least child friendly thing we have ever done of Halloween. Major Point 2: Disney is designed to get the most money out of you in the least amount of time possible. Given that they own everything, and you pay an exorbitant amount of money to get in, get some staff that actually want to work there. I would say 50% of the people we met who worked there couldn't appear more pissed off if they tried. The worst customer service I have seen anywhere in North America. Major Point 3: This is NOT a child  centric   child orientated or friendly place to bring small children. It is certainly more suited to older kids above the age of 8. We have a tall 4 year old, but saw several pre schoolers literally pushed out of the way because they were just too short. At least let them down lightly; maybe a sticker , or badge. There are no chill out areas to go with small one's. Be warned, when its busy it is just hellish. This can't be right in a park with this much real estate? It is so geared to getting money out of your pocket that you have to really work hard to look for highlights. Last Major Point: The Characters....ABSENT ABSENT ABSENT   I used the Disney app to try and track down characters that my 4 year old was dreaming of meeting, and that are littered all over the 'Disney Marketing videos'....we hardly saw any characters in either park. The most characters we saw was in the nighttime parade, other than that they are noticeable only by their absence. It is quite shocking given the price, marketing and anticipation for the kids that you can't find anyone, and the rare few you do you have to que for 30 minutes for the privilege of a photograph.....you HAVE to que because there are so few of them around. Today, Friday 30th in DisneyLand main park, in the space of 3 hours walking pretty much the entire area, we saw Thor and Captain America at the end of a very long que. That was it. After we gave up and decided to leave, we saw a tap dancing chip munk with about 20 people stood around, and a line of 50 people queuing for a picture with a giant pumpkin...that pretty much summed it up for me....Where was Peter Pan, Buzz, Woody, Monsters Inc, The Neverland Pirates, Mickey, Mini, Pluto, and so on. Disney would say, hey they were there, check the app. Well I have nothing to gain by saying otherwise. If they are there you have to search; hard. Which with a 4 year old is not easy in 31 degrees. Shouldn't the theme park be full of these characters enriching the experience? Halloween Party.....shouldn't there be trick or treat everywhere along the stroll, in the shops, on the street, like there is in most places outside on Halloween? Not a few special trick or treat trails with a 40 minute line up of immature dressed up adults? Trick or treat is for the kids, not adults for christ sakes. If they could put the effort and occasion into everything that they put into the the parade and fireworks it might live up to the marketing hype. But they don't The rides are old and tired and appear to be breaking down or in need of repair, the tickets are over sold and over priced, and the food is mostly over priced with poor service and lack of care. All in all I would not recommend anyone visit Disneyland with young kids. Maybe its a different experience with older, more worldly wise kids, but with an almost five year old that things Buzz Lightyear is a real Space Hero, and who truly believes that there is a Neverland with Pirates, its pretty rough constantly explaining that they must have gone to save the day or be having a lunch break....and sorry buddy I know we've been queuing an hour, but we're almost there....oh you need the potty....and yes I know its scary with so many people...save yourself a small fortune an use the money for an actual vacation...their about the same price!!!!!",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

They continue to successfully raise prices because they have the best marketing team in the world and all I can see is crowd sizes growing each time I come meaning we are still willing to pay that amount for  the Happiest Place in the World . We were frustrated so we went to Disney city hall to see if we could get swapped to California. Nope. Just an offer for one fast pass to a single attraction in Disney. Thanks but we said no and left.

571,321161464,1,2015-10,United States,"As a frequent visitor of Disneyworld in Florida and a Disney shareholder, I was incredibly excited to finally see the other side of the country's rendition on the Disney Magic. I love Disney, almost to the point you would think I could see no wrong in anything about it. Instead, here I am to review the park as terrible, and that's even after Town Hall tried to  make my stay more magical  (which, even that, was said with disdain by the disgruntled woman behind the counter.) It started out with a 40 minute line just to park, which cost something like $20, and requires a 5 minute walk before reaching trams, which were another 30 minute wait. My mother can't walk well, so this was a frustrating beginning to the day, but we were able to rest. We finally made it into the park after buying expensive park hoppers   9:15 AM. We went to California adventure first because of the crowd waiting to get into Disneyland. Might have been the best part of the day, because the lines at their longest in California Adventure were only 95 minutes... and then we dared to go to Disneyland's  Magic Kingdom  style park. 205 minutes was a normal wait time, and Space Mountain was broken down    then they shut down Haunted Mansion! The crowd was so terrible we couldn't move, and NO ONE respected my mother's mobility issues. It was like trying to get on the subway in New York EVERY STEP of the way!Problems with the stay, besides the crowd and the wait:  Disney Dining packages were sold out by 9:00 AM.  NO sense of  Cast Member  Pride. The employees in the stores that could not find the product I desired did not call around to try and find it, they shunted me off to the next store in the line, citing time and overcrowding. The actors running down Main Street had no passion in their performance, and even STOPPED LIP SYNCHING before they were even  backstage ! Mickey Mouse himself while singing  California Here I Come  made exasperated hand motions to mock the fact no one was paying attention to him as they waited to go behind the scenes, holding up his hands and shrugging as his voice over claimed  This crowd is bumping!  I wish I had my camera out, it was flabbergasting to witness!  Worst Cast Member Faux Pas: When we asked the Haunted Mansion  Line Starts Here  Cast Member if the dreadful crowds and sea of frowning faces was really the norm for Disneyland, he acknowledged our question by looking at us, SCOFFED, and WALKED AWAY. I cannot explain to you our shock and dismay   this is unheard of in Disneyworld.  Ride Breakdowns and under staffing: 2 rides with  single rider  lines did not have them open due to  under staffing,  according to the ride Cast Members. The only saving grace is that the  food court  area in California adventure had good food in good quantities for very reasonable prices (though drinks were a bit obscenely priced at nearly $4 each.) Normally I would give another star at least for the fact that, at the end of the day, we did make a complaint and someone did try to 'remedy' the situation. She offered fastpasses on our card for rides that were closed down, however, and the dust caking the entirety of Town Hall   the moldy air vents made an uncomfortable conversation worse. She was begrudgingly helpful and offered as little as she thought she could get away with to us. Disneyworld   whenever we have even the smallest problem   sometimes goes above and beyond to fix something we didn't even complain about! Here we were having to suggest to her what she do to make us whole... in DISNEY!! If you're familiar at all with Orlando, the service bends over backwards to make your stay valuable and magical. This woman just wanted us out the door! And she took us out, too... after issuing new park hoppers to  try again,  she invalidated our current ones and escorted us out (amicably, granted) and finally offered a SPECIFIC apology for the evening, which she turned somehow into a remark about Disneyworld, as if we were spoiled by it. I am sincerely hoping that was just my take away of it, and not her actual intention, so i'll offer benefit of the doubt there. Honestly, I'm not sure we'll ever use our  try again  park hoppers to visit a place where the Cast Members don't even attempt to care about the Disney mission, and I sincerely regret having wasted our money on the parks in the first place. We should have pressed for a refund instead. The UNHAPPIEST birthday celebration for my mother on her 60th birthday ever, and it was during their 60th anniversary celebration.

573,320241751,1,2015-10,United States,"Very disappointed in the crowds. I expected to wait in lines but the chaos of just trying to walk in the park was unreal. Disney really needs to figure out a way to control how many people enter the park. When families travel a long distance and pay thousands of dollars for a vacation it is frustrating to have so many local season pass holders making lines excruciatingly long and walking from point A to B difficult. Good solution would be to limit the amount of locals allowed in the park per day so that people who are paying full price plus the cost of travel can have an enjoyable vacation.Next problem was the rides breaking down very frequently. No customer service to make it right for people who were significantly inconvenienced by waiting in lines for 1 2 hours just to be sent away. Way too many rides were broken down for very long durations. I get that things break but 5 years ago when we were at Disneyland this problem didn't occur.Thirdly there is no magic. Difficult to see the characters and they just leave little kids (and big kids) standing in line, disappointed and sad because they didn't get to see the character. There needs to be more characters out in the park making guests smile and interacting because that is why people go to Disneyland, for the  magic and happiness . Disneyland is far from being the happiest place on earth.Fourth it is annoying when people pay thousands to get there and stay in a hotel have to pay full price for everything and locals who already have less expense get discounts. Why not lower the prices for everyone? A pen that should cost at most $0.50 is $10.00.Fifth you pay for a full day pass but the park closes early and there is no compensation for it. Pathetic. Lastly, the staff in general was neither friendly or rude with the exception of a few. They didn't seem to care whether guests were happy but they just did the minimal amount to complete their jobs so they wouldn't get fired. Overall, be prepared for uncomfortably long waits for 30 seconds of most likely mediocre experience, extremely high prices for everything, dirty crowded bathrooms, packed walkways, long food lines, poor seating, rides and shows that break down frequently, and staff that mostly doesn't care that you spent a lot of money to go to the  happiest place on earth .",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

Everywhere we tried to stand we were told we had to move yet they have sections blocked off with empty benches for 'company' employees. We watched the clean up people walk along and make an attempt to sweep a piece of paper into their receptacle but if they missed it, they just walked on.

Overbooked, understaffed, overpriced, under maintained. This is the first time I have run into so many curt, smile less  cast members . But I can understand based on the mass numbers of totally self absorbed, entitled park visitors they must deal with every day.And based on the numbers, and what appeared to be a very short staffed park, cleanliness suffered. Used to be every restroom, cafe, ride and venue was spotless and shiny. Not this trip. So many men's rooms with wet floors...and not from being cleaned... So may eateries with dirty tables, usually hogged by families that weren't even eating, just looking for some place out of the heat to sit, while those people that actually bought food had to stand or find someplace else to eat.Many areas were just not very well kept or clean, though it appeared they were trying. But with so many people jammed into the park, it's obviously impossible to keep up.And the jazzy's and scooters were everywhere. Not to mention the gazillion strollers, many of which didn't have kids in them...but were filled with coolers, backpacks and bags...no children in sight. Maybe, just maybe, if they were to drop the price of the food people wouldn't insist on bringing in so much extra stuff and they'd probably sell more than enough to make up for the lower prices. And while I'm on a roll, what's with the single rider lines? Whole families would get in line in the very much shorter single rider lines just to avoid waiting like the rest of the people willing to play by the rules. Plus car full after car full of wheel chair and scooter riders. Sorry, but if you are truly that bad off physically, should you be riding Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad...? Luckily, we fell for the con and bought a multiple day pass, thus adding to the masses, and were eventually able to ride most of what we wanted to, in spite of more than one  popular  ride being shut down sometimes for hours each day.Not sure if we'll make the trip again.

The park was crowded, producing long waits on all the rides and the weather was unseasonably hot to add to the misery. Crowds and weather cannot be controlled by Disney but their cast members can and should be. I have never had a cast member be anything but pleasant to me and rudeness seems to be the new norm. I am not a fan of the crowd control techniques either. At both the parade and Fantasmic, standing is required to squeeze in more people. A group that had been sitting for almost two hours for the parade was required to stand before the parade start despite the fact that there was no clamor to join the viewing. It was infuriating because eight rows deep, everyone could see perfectly. After standing, only the first two rows could see. Tall people and children on shoulders made viewing from three rows back obstructed at best. After the parade, everyone was sent on a forced march around the trail behind Big Thunder. If Disney is going to force people to make this trek in the dark, they need to install adequate lighting. The Fastpass system for Fantasmic is a nightmare of jostling angry crowds who have no hope of getting a good view. Only those with deep enough pockets to shell out for a dining experience could get a reserved seat with decent viewing. Shade structures or more shade trees and fans are desperately needed on some rides for guests standing in long lines on hot days. New, cool things included the castle decked out for the 60th anniversary and the new light parade. The new Frozen area on the Storybook boat ride is well done as well. None of this made up for being treated poorly by employees at every turn.Oh and be careful about traveling in September and October.

No way.We went to city hall for our first time visitor badges as recommended by a fellow traveller. This would enable staff to ensure we were looked after. Now this would have been the time for the staff to tell us about fast lanes but they didn't and it wasn't until we asked why people were passing us in the lines using a different lane that another traveller explained. Check them out if you are going as they could save you hours of waiting. There is nothing slick about this place. We queued for tickets even and the process was very slow. We queued for lunch which was absolutely awful and I will review the French Market later if I can. We queued for toilets. One woman was sitting on the floor breastfeeding. I suspect there may have been somewhere else more comfortable for her but she obviously didn't know and no one bothered to tell her. There is loads more I can say but you have the picture.

After only spending half the day at the original park, we left frustrated.

We enjoyed visiting with the big 5 at the main gate and then rode a total of 4 rides. There were a few that allowed us to enter the handicapped entrance and it was appreciated. Then we went to Pirates. We were told that there were too many people that pretend they are handicapped and now Disney just gives fast passes (which means you still stand around 30 minutes after your designated time and are mixed in with able bodied people who have fast passes). The service and quality have gone down hill and dad was sorely disappointed in the park because it was so much better when he was a kid. It was not as crowded, and the people were friendlier. We won't even waste our time here next year. 90 minute wait times per ride is the norm. As the day progresses the crowds just get worse and worse.

Then it spits out the pass. At 10am we got 6 pm. As there was no place to escape the heat in the park, we exited to the Grand Californian Hotel. The bar was cool and pleasant. After a hard cider for me and a JW for Jack, we were happier. This was followed by a stop at Uva. It's always pleasant but still hot since it's outside.

I have raised guide dogs and been a breeder keeper.  I have attended the Disney Institute training required by my employerWe planned this trip to celebrate our anniversary. Decided to go all out and stay on the property for the convenience of being within walking distance of the parks. Also wanted to see the Halloween d  cor and the kids in their costumes as we were there during the trick or treat events (we did not attend, it was an additional fee on top of the passes we purchased, and the park closed at 6pm these nights). As we arrived after the park had opened, stood in line for 45 minutes to enter the park. This was just the beginning of our many  waits  in line. Sure we know about the fast passes but since you can only have one at a time didn't really help with the lines. I wasn't impressed with the decorations, expected much more. Due to the drought (I think?) there weren't the normal beautiful flower displays which add a lot of color and character to the park. For the first time ever, the park appeared worn and outright dirty in some places. The water around the castle was green and there was a lot of garbage, including a dead duck floating in it. Bathrooms weren't all clean. The areas leading to the rides were sticky and some smelled badly. Not the DL I remember. I was immediately struck by the number of people on scooters and the number of double and triple wide strollers. As safety is the number one concern for all Disney experiences, it became quite clear it was very unsafe due to the number of these devices parked all over and trying to maneuver through the park. If there were to be any kind of emergency many people will be trampled or hit. The park was not designed for this type of traffic, along with the thousands of people, especially in the narrower areas especially in Fantasyland. Had stopped behind a scooter that stopped in the middle of the flow of traffic and was struck from behind by a stroller. Had contusions and a great deal of swelling on my leg that was hit. The  dad  stopped and asked if I was okay, I was nearly knocked to the ground and too shocked to speak, he just shrugged his shoulders and took off. I limped over to sit down and struck up a conversation with an employee who said, I quote  You can go over to first aid and get an ice pack. I'm really sorry but wow, you should see the scooter injuries when they run over someone!  Confirmed what I had thought many of the people on the scooters were dangerous drivers! The second point in regards to the scooters. I'm not talking about the veteran who had lost both his legs and had his own scooter, nor the man who had part of his foot removed and was in a real cast, nor the 93 year old who couldn't walk. You see if you claim you are disabled you, and your party of however many you want, get to go in the exit and go to the front of line. Furthermore if you truly need a scooter by Disneyland's protocol's posted at the front of the rides, you would not be healthy enough to ride many of the attractions again not talking about small world! This was every time we got on and off a ride we had to wait for people who came in through the exit. In fact outside of pirates there was again, a safety concern, as there were so many scooters lined up to come in the exit that we could not exit the ride. My fav was the lady impersonating a visually impaired person when she was obviously not. Nor did the dog have the appropriate harness or identification. We were having lunch in Frontierland outside. She let the dog off leash (never allowed in public, unsafe for the dog, all guide dogs are trained to leash relieve for this purpose) and let it go into a display under the fence and poop. Right next to where we were eating. Just so wrong on so many levels. I understand DL has areas for therapy dogs to relieve themselves and this was not one of them!The food was good but overpriced by 50 75% with small portions. The service was hit and miss, saw many employees on their cell phones (not their work phones), yawning, not all super friendly as in the past. Also over heard many complaining about their managers or their hours. Couldn't blame them for complaining about the rude customers because I agreed with them. The magic hour, while a good idea, didn't work out so well in DL because they had several of the areas closed so everyone who came in early was packed into 2 of the areas instead of the whole park. The 60th anniversary fireworks were spectacular, the other nights not so much. So what has changed? Society? Disney? Perhaps a combination of both. Overall witnessed so many rude people, pushing and shoving, grown men and women running nearing knocking over little kids. The scooter group just really out of control. Too many examples to list after a few days at the park. Couldn't help but feel ripped off after what we spent for the package we purchased after dealing with the massive crowds and lines. Lastly, will end as most days at DL should with the light parade. We noticed people staking out their spots 2 hours ahead of time so we decided for one night we would do the same. We sat on the ground for 1.5 hours with specific instructions from DL staff that when they told us to stand, we must stand and remain standing until the parade was over behind the white rope and in front of the rope in the back. Where we were standing there was enough room for one person. For safety reasons, no one could sit on the curb in front of us due to the size of the floats. People became frantic and tried to push us from the back, them from the front to take our spots. The couple next to us, an adult and her elderly mom in leg braces and on crutches, literally had to hold onto the light poll as people were trying to push in. Thankfully a security guard was placed behind us to protect us. The parade was about to start and a lady came running over pushing a small toddler in a stroller who she then dumped out as ran onto the curb. Her husband came up behind with a double stroller, the DL employee tells her she can't stay there, her toddler in the ground crying, and she proceeds to stand and yell at those of us (who have been there for 2 hours) about her  right  to see the parade and who we were preventing her children from seeing the parade. She then turned and yelled at her husband. Really? So we saw the parade, lasted about 12 minutes, so not worth the hassle and all the people who yelled at us for taking  their space.  We won't return until many years later when we have grand kids perhaps by then DL will have figured out how to manage the crowds better. I fear though by then we won't be able to afford to go, seriously do not understand how the family's that were there could afford it! Tips: Don't plan too much in one day. Best not to have a schedule or be on time limits, that is what worked best for us due to the crowds and wait times. Bring your own food. We don't have small children but would consider bringing a small umbrella stroller to store food and water but more importantly to maneuver through the crowds more safely. Go as early as you can. Talked to locals who reported the locals come after school and work thus the park gets busier as the day goes on. Downtown Disney is a nice place to get away from the crowds, but then requires standing in line to re enter.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

I understand that it was a busy weekend but it costs a lot of money to get into the parks so maybe this staff needs to learn from the Florida cast on how to treat guests. There was a cast member name Justin who worked at the Avengers picture area and when the cast was going to switch characters he told us in line to be patient and that the world would keep spinning.

People joke about being Disney  crazy with us, having lots of disney toys, all the movies, clothes, paintings, decorations, snack foods, & even Disney stocks. We always have looked forward to our Disney vacations, even though it is 16 hours to get there. However, for the last few years things at the Parks have been going down hill. It has become more of a local hang out, & not the magical place that you feel the excited butterflies weeks before the trip. We were actually very glad when our vacation week was up this last trip. Not that we wanted to go back home to school and work, but we definitely did not want to endure the let down of Disneyland any longer. I never thought we would say that! We have been visiting several times a year starting in 2009. We loved it so much that we started to bring other families with us. But none of our friends & family can stand the over crowding anymore, & don't want to waste their money & vacations. No one wants to get excited to see a beautiful parade or go on fun ride only to spend the bulk of your time packed among thousands of unhappy people, & not able to see or do much of anything! Also, with that much over crowding, the cleanliness is not at all what it used to be. Many of the bathrooms last week looked & felt like I was in a road side gas station with the plugged up toilets & trash on the floor. I now see why people associated sickness & desease with going to Disneyland.

We looove the California Adventure Park. Disneyland Park is just ok. For starters it is REALLY old. We were visiting for two days and Space Mountain broke down while we were in line, the Haunted house broke down, the Matterhorn broke down, Splash Mountain broke down, Winnie the Pooh Broke down....and every single break down happened when we were already in line!!! Secondly, the set up of Disneyland was poorly executed....a perfect example would be that you have to walk all the way into Critter Land at the back of Frontierland to get to Splash Mountain, and there is only one way in and one way out!!! This creates traffic jams and dangerous situations when the park is crowded and hot. Speaking of hot...why is there no place to cool down in Disneyland? There are no sprayers, no water squirters, no trees, no nice shady canopies, nothing! We actually walked into Toonland hoping to find the same spray area that they have in Disney World, to find that there is nothing. You feel like you are in the desert, oh wait, you are. Fourth, I have said it once and I will say it again. Raise the prices and let fewer people into the parks. When it is this crowded it is not enjoyable. We don't even go during the busy times. I can't imagine the hell that must be. Lastly, Disneyland needs to update their app and their fast pass system. In a day of electronics it seems a bit backward to me to be running from fast pass kiosk to fast pass kiosk, when you should be able to just click a link on your phone.

First of all I purchased a one day park hopper ticket from my hotel for $155. I find it extremely expensive to go to both Disneyland and California Adventure. I can go to other theme parks in the Los Angeles area for about $60 a day. I walked into the park and it was packed. I wasn't really surprised because it was a weekend and it was Disneyland. I wanted to get in line for Star Tours. It was an hour wait so I decided to get a fast pass. I tried getting on Space Mountain which was another hour wait. So I tried to get a fast pass and it wouldn't let me get one because I had the one for Star Tours. I remembered when I went in 2012 I could get an unlimited number of fast passes but now I can't. I finally got on the Haunted mansion after an HOUR in the park. I wouldn't have a problem in waiting in these lines if they would put more shade up. It happened to be one of the hottest days in Anaheim and I got hot quick. After that I got in this huge line for the Star Tours Fast Passes. Now I thought we were allowed to go in immediately once our time was called, that did not happen. They let small groups of 4 people go in at a time. Of course the line is in the heat and I started to get furious. I decided to get lunch and bought Gumbo and a drink for $15. I went to California Adventure afterward to go ride some rides. I go in line for Screaming over California. Since I was by myself I could ride single rider. I walk to the guy and he told me I had to wait in the regular line. I wanted to cuss him out.

Reliability of the rides was substandard. Splash mountain had a break down when we were in line with fast pass, a raft ride in California adventure broke down when in line with fast pass. Pirates of the Caribean closed. The fast pass apparently has quotas and could not be used for the cars ride in California adventure. The ART transportation sign outside of Disney is out dated. We got on the wrong bus. Route 2 has changed and sign is not updated. Another problem was we had a 3 day ART pass. These are only 3 consecutive uses, so be mindful if you take a day off Disney park.

Each day the high was over 95 degrees reaching 100 with 45% humidity. What I saw in the park were many situations where people's health was endangered by heat and poor park design. I have also been to Disneyworld in the heat and felt comfortable because they were prepared for crowds in hot sunshine.What I experienced was long winding lines difficult to exit in full sunlight for over 45 minutes. Unlike Florida there are no misters (the only one I saw was in Soaring CA). There are also few canvas covers like you see in Florida.. The only transportation option from Disneyland hotel to the parks is the monorail for about half the ten block walk. Today it was closed from at least 3p to 8:30p BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HOT! Instead guests had to walk in the heat, is that safer? There are no trams. The trolleys that used to run down Main Street are gone. When I asked for transportation options in the heat I was told to rent a wheelchair.Most of the walkways are in full sun. Very few places to sit in shade. I saw many infants and toddlers with no hats being exposed to the sun. Several looked pale and lethargic. It was scary. A person I met said they saw an older woman get heat stroke and start convulsions. They tried to help her until a doctor arrived.I know monorails can be designed to run in the heat. I know Disney uses trams in the parking areas. I know Disneyland used to run trolleys on main roads. My only explanation for these lapses is that it forces the crowds to walk past all the stores encouraging people to come in from the heat and spend more money.I will never come to Disneyland in any month that may have a heat wave.

They also won't let you take any food in the park so they've got the racket pretty much set up.Miss information abounds in this enormous mass of parks. Whether it's the Information stand or a friendly cast member on the street; no one gives you the same directions for the same information no matter who you ask. The restrictions on times and the length of wait time on rides, even when you have fast pass, front of the line or upgraded tickets is ridiculous.  the absolute kicker was how truly unhappy and mean some of the park staff were. Including the security gate checkpoint Nazis and many of the staff and in service workers from hostesses to waiters. I found this to be the worst vacation I've ever gone on and would never set foot in another Disney park.

Also this particular hotel has an entrance for California adventure which comes in handy. However, the park itself was disappointing. It seriously appeared to be oversold as I can't imagine it was within the safe capacity. The main thoroughways were shoulder to shoulder continuously after about noon each day we were there. The entire crowd moved at an extremely slow pace, frustrating everyone. To make matters worse they began blocking off the main thoroughways at about 7pm for the parades, light shows, and fireworks. This made movement of the crowds near impossible. Forget trying to get to any of the destinations you were planning to get to. At the same time they close down 2 full sections of the park, toontown and fantasyland. This shoves even more people into less space. And to brighten your evening the cast members are there to continuously tell you to  keep moving  when the the entire crowd in front of you is standing still and there is literally no possible way anyone can move. Another odd change is that, there are long line areas where they used to have the lines but now they keep the guests waiting outside in the heat and let a few in at a time to make the long walk in the air conditioning where people standing outside could be (and used to be).

I discussed my frustration with security, as I feel telling people once they've been dragged across the parking lots about it isn't very fair. We had no problem about it being banned, just that then expecting us to spend more time going back on the tram, all through the parking lots to return it, then queue AGAIN was unreasonable.She said we take it back or put it in a locker (I think she said it was $15). whatever the price was, we bought the stick for less so it wasn't worth it. I eventually said just the keep the thing as my wife was getting quite distressed. After then queuing to enter, we went to the guest services. We discussed what had happened and how unhappy we were, to which we were given a flyer about the ban (I said this is useless now, it should've been given to us at the gate) and told  it's all in the news about places banning them . I explained I'm not from the USA, selfie stick bans aren't all over the news in the UK. He said that security should have offered to leave it at lost and found and get it back later. After explaining she never offered this and now we've lost our selfie stick for no reason, he was able to retrieve it and send it to lost and found.

But to say I loathe this place after our latest visit would be an understatement.This is our fourth visit in three years....I have never been a fan but my distaste is strong.Our biggest change and disappointment was the discontinuation of the former DAS program while there are still minor accommodations for those wanting to enjoy the park with disabilities it is a far reach one size fits all pass, that only applies to rides with current fast pass availability. Many of those rides are not the ones young children would seek out. We end up riding Astro Blasters all day because it's the most accommodating. This program could be better suited as a tiered program where the adjustments are made based on need. Physical disabilities require different accommodations than mental disabilities.The overall line durations were in the 45 90 minute range this is unacceptable in my opinion when paying over $100 per ticket per person per day.

This visit, I had a bad experience that has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am disappointed with the way Disney is handled a problem that I had. As most families do when they arrive at Disneyland, they stop to take a photo in front of the flowers at the entrance. We pre paid for our Disney Photo Pass so we wanted to take advantage of it. We stopped for several minutes to do some photos and there were 2 photographers there so we were able to take some pictures with our camera as well as his. When we walked off, my daughter left her sunglasses on the brick wall and realized it a couple of minutes later as we walked in front of City Hall. She ran back to the Photo Pass Photographers who had just took our pictures and asked if they had seen her prescription sunglasses and the Photo Pass Photographer told us that the photographer who took our pictures had the glasses and was taking them to lost and found!!! In the mean time, I had gone straight to Lost and Found to file a report. As with all things Disney, I had to stand in line for 45 minutes. Once I gave the report, the girl said that the photographer had not turned them in yet but for us to check back that evening or the next day. I called every day and that photographer never turned them in or the system at the Lost and Found is bad. These are $400, Kate Spade prescription sunglasses!! Sadly, sunglasses aren't covered on insurance and she had these glasses for one week. I don't know what to do. Lost and Found is no help.

Found our place for the night show and sat for 3 hours behind the rope, 15 minutes before show starts a rude female staff member tells us that this is a area for wheelchairs only, would have been nice to be told hours before the start of the show as there was other staff walking around who had not even approached up prior to this point. Perhaps organise the wheelchair area prior to 15 minutes before show time and perhaps don't demand people to move but explain in a nice manner. Maybe staff need to do some training in customer relations. Very disappointed considering this was the diamond anniversary and our family was so excited travelling half way across the world to be here only to have our experience ruined by rude staff.

Indiana Jones, Barges to the Island, Pirates of the Carabean, Peter Pan.... Some would be down for an hour some would be down more. Went over to the California Adventure Park and the Elevator Ride only had one of three elevators working. And the Crowds!!! If you are going to have broken rides then reduce the number of people entering the park. There were a lot of Disney Characters but those lines were long...always. The park is getting old and tired. They should either get their mechanical act together or reduce the number of tickets available. I recommend Six Flags or another park.

We told the employee, aka cast member, that we just got off the train and was setting up the stroller quickly and then we would be moving, and was told stroller or not, we would still have to move because the parade was going on and we was in the no parade watching walkway. We then told the cast member we wasn't watching the parade we was quickly setting up the stroller. She said sorry but you still have to move! We wasn't even blocking others people from walking by.Disneyland needs to train there employees, aka cast members, how to treat there guests. In the matter of 10 seconds it took to set up our stroller we had 3 cast members tell us there was no standing there. Unecceptable!!!We went to city hall to make a complaint about the parade usher cast members, we told them if they don't want people getting off the train during the parade that they should just shut the train station, and trains down during the parade.

648,284532797,1,2015-6,New Zealand,"What an absolutely miserable day we had at Disneyland.We arrived at around 12pm. The park was already extremely crowded, but it was nothing compared to what was to come.I would say that of the next 12 hours we spent at the park, about 10 minutes of it would have been on rides, and we were mostly there for the rides.The park clearly needs a limit on how many people can come at a time. The amount of people that were in the park was beyond a joke. It was to the point where in some places you were unable to move. There are people with prams everywhere, even at 10pm , and in a crowd of thousands of people, it simply doesn't work. It's a place that is obviously completely about the money and not about the experience.The lines for the rides were beyond ridiculous. At least an hour per ride, and multiple times in line the rides experienced 'technical difficulties', which added an extra 15 minutes   at a time.Though Disneyland is obviously a children's theme park, it is certainly not up to date with it's rides.They shut massive sections and pathways off in the park in preparation for the parades, quite far in advance. How they justify this I have no idea as when thousands of people are at a stand still while there is a massive empty path right next to them, it seems quite crazy.When we went to leave the park, the tram service that shuttles you back to carpark also experienced 'technical difficulties'. Instead of informing us of this, the staff just left us standing there. We would have waited the best part of an hour before deciding to just walk back to the carpark, which was not a short distance. There were thousands of people left having to do this with no communication from the staff. On the walk to the car, we had staff on the trams condescendingly and rudely waving at us and laughing. They were genuinely the rudest people I have come across this far in the States.It would seem that Disneyland is so full of procedure (I can only assume from being Sued) that the staff are essentially unable to make any decisions for themselves. How many Disneyland staff would it take to screw in a lightbulb? I dread to think.I have wanted to go to Disneyland my whole life, and I can say in all honestly that not only was it BY FAR the worst theme park experience of my life, but that it was one of the least enjoyable days of my life. It sure as hell is not the happiest place in the World.Between the 6 of us we probably spent $1000 USD for the day out, which is incredibly depressing considering how miserable of an experience it was. If someone offered me $1000 to go back and do the day again, I would definitely decline.As a theme park, it barely functions, the service is horrendous, and the over all experience is horrible. I could probably go on all day about how much of a let down it was, but I'm sure Disneyland don't care, as they already have our money.We would never go back, I suggest you don't go either.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

I'm sure there were more across the way at California Adventure since there are more thrill rides there. I strategically picked this day because it was a black out date for annual pass holders and the magic morning (one hour early arrival for Disneyland resort guests) was at California Adventure that day. Still, the crowds were ridiculous. Everyone sidewalk was packed, every line for each ride was long, and even the lines to eat very mediocre and over priced food were long. If you want a good view of one of the free parades or shows, you have to arrive an hour early and sit. We had fast passes to Fantasmic (wonderful show by the way), but the view was not that great and arriving earlier and getting one of the expensive dinner packages would have provided better views. After the 9 PM Fantasmic show, we tried to see the 9:30 PM fireworks, but they basically roped off the better viewing areas on Main Street (because it is packed and they let tons of people into the park in the evening just to view the fireworks), so there was nowhere for us to stand to watch the fireworks because they kept saying  you can't stand there  and we basically got ushered out of the park because there was nowhere else to go. On top of the that, there was a glitch in the fireworks show, and it stopped shortly after it began and never finished. And then the number of rides that were not available was annoying as well. In the morning, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and the Haunted Mansion were all not available. Peter Pan's flight and Innoventions were both out the entire day and the Storybook Land Canal boats were out most of the afternoon. We were able to get Fastpass to ride Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion. We obtained the Space Mountain Fastpass at noon and had to return at 4:25 pm to go on the ride. Splash Mountain only opened up later in the afternoon and by the time I came by, the wait was 120 minutes and there were out of Fastpasses. We did enjoy a handful of the rides, most notably the Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, and the Disneyland Railroad. The park is very clean for the number of people that go through it and we still had some memorable moments. That being said, for $100 ticket, I don't feel I got my money's worth. I do recommend you arrive at the time they open because you can at least go on a few rides without long waits.

Our kids go to a private school and finished a week before the public schools, so we thought we could beat the summer rush and enjoy a couple of relaxing days in the parks. Boy were we wrong. Every school in the Anaheim area was at Disneyland for end of year trips.The GOOD:  The weather was definitely better than Florida.   Lots of hotels close to Disneyland (two miles or less)  Tram ride was very short and parking was easy (because the park is so much smaller)The BAD:  There are probably half the rides for basically the same ticket price  Fireworks were cancelled because of high winds. The winds weren't bad, but I expect this had more to do with the park being landlocked with houses and commercial property all around it.   Crowds for the parades are Crazy. The park is smaller which means the parade routes are smaller. Fewer places for people to view   incredible crowding.   Two rides in Disneyland were completely down.   Two rides at California Adventure went down. One of which was Radiator Springs Racers, which kept going down ALL DAY. I complained to Guest Services, but they didn't really seem to care. They told me that when a ride breaks, they give complementary Fast Pass tickets. I explained that this doesn't compensate when you are next in line and the ride breaks. A fast pass still ends up being another 20 30 minute wait for the same ride. All in all, it's nice to say I've been here, but I'll NEVER come back.

Our daughters were excited to meet the Disney characters, they had seen and read so much about them   the long queues with up to 50 mins wait time just to take pictures with their favourite characters, ruined that excitement.4. There were characters like Cinderella hurrying past weaving through the crowd in Fantasyland. By the time we could tell our daughters 'Look Cinderella' the characters disappeared from our view. We were told the characters will be in a hall in Fantasyland where we could meet them. By the time we reached there it was 6 pm and we were told that the characters have left for the day. Disneyland is open till 10 pm, how can the characters leave at 6 pm?5. We missed quite a few important shows because of 6 7 hours of standing in queues. Later we learnt that there is a system of fast pass wherein we could avoid the queues for some shows by showing up in a specified time window. We had spent 30 mins at the Disneyland entrance in the morning speaking with multiple Disneyland executives trying to find out the best 1 day tickets for us but nobody told us about the fast pass system.6. Any to top it all, there are no parades on Mondays and a few other week days. We had missed that information. So no parades for the children. We left the park around 11 pm and we did not see any fireworks as well.Overall, I am disappointed with our 'first' visit to Disneyland. I had read about Disneyland in MBA school. I had promised so much to the kids. And all we did was stand in the queues   well, mostly. The shows and rides were great but the crowd (on a Monday) really took everything away.

They charge way tooooo much for admission AND parking. Random rides are always closed or break down while you've been in line for an hour. During parades and shows, they heard you like cattle through the street and paths. You can't walk where you want to walk, there are ropes everywhere and people with light sticks herding you down paths you don't want to walk, and in one way directions. You can't stand anywhere. This is as a result of overselling tickets of course. With all of Disneyland's money, is it really necessary to sell so many tickets that there is no enough room in the park for everyone? For the rides, the fast passes are great; you just have to be organized. Not all the rides have them available. Who ever thought I'd be reviewing Disneyland? We and our kids had a great first half. Once the  herding  and  gridlock  started, it was horrible! Not a nice way to end the night! They need to work on this!

We came 2000 miles for this experience! He never even got to SEE Mickey because he was in an area where he couldn't go with his cart! And because there was no welcome in the morning , no parade day or night, he never saw the characters her grew up with! I was very sad and disappointed for him and the rest of the group! There was one other Disney first timer with us also! Disappointed!I do respect the fact that it's OFF season so perhaps an off season rate should be offered or at least paying customers should be made aware of the lack of attractions at the time of purchase!

682,270002442,1,2015-4,United States,"This was our second annual birthday trip to Disneyland for my daughter, and unfortunately, I cannot write a positive review this time. Not only were the cast members in the Disneyland park incredibly rude and seemingly unhappy in their jobs, which we could have overlooked, we were duped into purchasing an over priced meal that advertized receipt of a Fastpass for Fantasmic, to which we were mislead and believed were for special seating The meal at Aladdin's Oasis was $19.99 per person and consisted of microwaved lasagna, a tiny salad, dinner roll and some cheesecake. The meal, with the exception of the dinner roll, was awful!! And in no way was worth half of what we paid!!! However, we thought it worth it to get a good view of the show at the end of our tired day (mind you, this was the end of our FIFTH day at Disney parks)! Prior to purchasing this barely digestible  food,  we ASKED two separate cast members about the details....not to mention, on the Disneyland schedule that promotes the purchase of food in exchange for a Fastpass, it implies that the viewing spot would be better than if we did not have them. We arrived at the Blue section 45 minutes before the show started (we were told that we only needed to be there fifteen minutes early because we had the passes). When we arrived, we were directed way over to the other side and in the standing only section. W T F?! I spent $60 on crap food to have to stand AND for my daughter to not even be able to see over people's heads?! I don't think so!! I spoke with a cast member, Amber, who was as helpful as she could possibly be....however, the other viewing spots she suggested were all standing only. We opted out. Not only was my daughter's view obstructed, her little legs just couldn't handle it; and quite frankly, neither could mine. I was told that other people who went to the more expensive restaurants were entitled to SEATED viewing  but I wasn't....because they spent more than me. But the real kicker  the Blue section that we got with our $60 lunch  was the EXACT SAME SECTION FOR THOSE THAT GOT REGULAR FASTPASSES....FOR FREE!!!!!! It's possible that I dropped the  F  bomb at that point. This trip cost us thousands of dollars  and we spent over a thousand dollars during the week we were there....yet Disney is apparently hard up.Guest Relations was a JOKE!!!! The gentleman that  helped  us never once smiled and even admitted himself that the food at Aladdin's Oasis is disgusting. He offered absolutely NO resolve other than telling me to write a complaint to guest relations on Disneyland's website. Given our horrible experience with rude cast members (Amber at Fantasmic was the ONLY exception), the park being WAY over crowded and getting suckered into purchasing a crap meal for crap fastpasses  I'm not thinking we'll be spending my daughter's birthday at Disney next year.

NOT THE CASE. We arrived 30 minutes prior to the show and we were literally stuck behind a tree with all the people who got normal fast passes and didn't pay for the dinner experience. Not to mention the fact that the food was sub par. The lasagna was rubbery and the chicken was dry. You were given only 3 options and you're forced to have to pick a time that is well before the actual show time.

715,257743166,2,2014-4,Mexico,"This is the letter I  ve wrote to Disneyland about my family  s experience .. I haven  t receive any answer .. :(To whom it may concern:My name is VR. and last year, (April 12 19, 2014), my family and I traveled together to Los Angeles for the first time. (We are from Guadalajara, Mexico.) We took our two children, my mother and sister. My mother and sister had never traveled out of the country, so we were very excited for them to have this experience. Our son Denji is disabled and suffers from Trisomy 22. He is 14 years old yet is mentally like a 1 year and a half old infant. He suffers from a severe cognitive disability and even though he walks, he can't do so for a prolonged period of time. He also suffers from a form of autism, making him very sensitive to stimuli and becoming easily anxious. We were aware that it would be a tough trip, and for that reason we were prepared with all the supplies we would need including his carriage and a whole lot of patience. On our first day, we went to Universal Studios, and the entire staff made our day fun and pleasant, providing us with all the necessary accommodations. Since my son can't go on the rides they gave us access through the back door of the rides and permitted us to do the  child switch  when necessary. The staff was also very kind, wishing my daughter (who was turning 9) and my sister (who was turning 17) a happy birthday and giving them candy and treats for that reason. Universal Studios set high standards for us, and after learning about Disney's exemplary customer service standards during my Master's Degree in Marketing, I expected a high degree of customer service during our visit. Even after informing myself about all the recommendations for people with disabilities on the Disney website, I would've never imagined that our Disney experience would be quite the opposite from what everyone knows to be a  Disney experience .When at the Disney California Adventure Park, the staff did not allow us to the child switch or even allow one of us to be in line for our entire party. If my son could only understand that the rides are not dangerous or that being in line for a very long time poses no threat to him, we wouldn't have had a problem in waiting in line as a group, but due to his condition, being surrounded with people in a line makes him very anxious. The only solution that we were offered was a FastPass for him, and they specified that it was mandatory for him to go on the ride per se. We used it as much as we could, but after a long day and after being in a long line to go on the  Cars  ride, my son had an anxiety attack. We told a staff member about the situation and asked her to please allow us to do a child switch, for after being in line for so long and due to the time it wouldn't have been possible for us to get in line again. She did not allow us to do the child switch and unfortunately that impeded us from enjoying that attraction. It's not that we are inconsiderate parents but we're also parents of a 9 year old girl with no disabilities, and with all the hopes and dreams of going to Disney. We had to divide our family into two separate groups, and unfortunately Disney made it more complicated. The majority of the staff members didn't greet us and few of them wished my daughter or sister a happy birthday; thing which they awaited with expectation. What I wish to ask from Disney is to reevaluate your customer service for people with disabilities and consider that there's not only one type of disability, being the inability to move, but rather different degrees. If Disney could only be more responsive to the needs of families like ours, we wouldn't have suffered from this terrible experience, along with other families who may have experienced similar situations. I understand we're a minority but we also wish to enjoy from special moments at Disney like others do. We sacrificed many things to make our trip there and it's a shame that we went through all that in  the happiest place on Earth , where customer service and marketing techniques are said to be exemplary. This April we will be going to Walt Disney World in Orlando. I truly hope that our experience will be much different... Thank you so much for you time and consideration. Sincerely yours, Vania RochaP.S. I saved the FastPass they gave us.

I can buy into the  magic  that happens here and occasionally I'll even come home with bags of Mickey crap even though once I've left the hypnotic pull of pixie dust Mickey doesn't fit into my daily life. However, this trip to Disneyland was such a big disappointment. Of course, the tickets were outrageously expensive   a family of five being about $1,000 for three day park hopper passes   but given the meticulous care and effort Disney gives to maintaining the grounds and it's image you understand why. On this trip though, so many of the rides were shut down   Small World, Matterhorn, Peter Pan to name a few. There were restaurants that were shut as well. Very frustrating when you shell out a lot of money, this is your kids' first time going and you know that Disneyland isn't a trip that my family can afford very often. Maybe because I have very young children now the insane length of the lines for the rides and the wait time takes all the joy out of the experience. It's not magical when you have to wait for trams to take you to the park, wait in lines for security to check your bags, wait in line to buy tickets, wait in lines to have your tickets checked, wait in lines for rides and wait in lines to eat.

720,252117062,1,2015-1,United States,"Sad. . . . Really Disney??? I read and updated myself before coming to Disneyland on disability services. My last visit was 10 years ago. This was to be my first visit using a scooter. (I can't walk long distances or stand for long periods) and, to Celebrate my granddaughters second birthday. I did what was advised, went to city hall and was met with,  What is your PROBLEM today?  From there, it just got worse. These are just the highlights of what I encountered throughout my one day visit. I am saddened that I was met with cast members who spoke to me like I was a child! I had a party of two adults (me  53yrs old, my daughter 22yrs old and one 2 year old) I have a positive attitude, am courteous, educated, speak well and pride myself on my communication skills. My  simple  question was met with  scolding  tones. I asked the Indiana Jones Ride attendant for procedures and was told,  If YOU are going to ride then . . . I was confused by his tone. Yes, I was the rider. I had help (my daughter) to transfer, but, we also had a two year old who couldn't ride, so tell me what we need to do . . . It became such a production, I left and didn't ride. I was invisible to the store clerks in Frontierland who was more involved with their profit sharing conversation and displeasure with the disney company to notice I needed help. I was walked along the whole perimeter of the Blue Bayou restaurant, when I could have easily been taken a shorter way. (I was told it was  company policy ) I found it insulting the host didn't even wait for me to arrive at the table. They show more care at IHOP. Andy, the manager (who was very apologetic and sweet) gave me a fast pass for Peter Pan to turn my bad experience around, but I really should have left. Blue Bayou was my kids  Treat  meal, I wanted to continue the tradition with my granddaughter, but for a restaurant that boasts excellent food and service that first encounter taught me, you can't relive your past. Disney, the icing on the cake was Fantasmic. I did everything I was supposed to. Got my fastpass early. Yellow section to boot. I checked at 5p with the yellow jacket personnel on where to line up and was told,  You line up here at 630p, not at 615p, not at 625p, but 630pm  Really? So i guess the 50  people who were there at 615p wasn't as fortunate as me to get her memo. BUT that most demeaning, degrading and icing on my cake of disappointment was the attendant who directed me back to the  Handicapped  section, and seated me directly in front of the lamp post. When I tired to explain that my view was being blocked, he cut me off and pretty much told me, he had more people to concern himself with. I spoke with manager after that. Disney, you broke me. Disappointed me. Made me feel like I was a bad child and punished me for being in a scooter. I held my tongue and disappointment for my daughter and granddaughter's sake, but I did the research! I followed the rules!!! We came during  off peak  season, as not to battle the crowds. we paid the same admission price for shorter park hours, but that was the trade off. My sacrifices were for nothing. I will be back, but the next time I will be better prepared, grow a tougher skin, fend for myself and tell everyone I know, my beloved Disney sees you through different eyes when you are on wheels. Even my letter of  concern  was met with a FORM letter of apology and a sincerely worded phone call apology, and then I'm sure was promptly filed in the trash can.

Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.First of all, the tickets were overpriced. While Disney is known to have overpriced tickets, at least at Disney World, there are so many things to do for all different ages that makes the ticket well worth it. Disneyland, although it has two parks, is extremely tiny in comparison. Meanwhile, the tickets are priced just as high with no justification.The Disneyland park is very similar to Magic Kingdom but on a small scale. The Sleeping Beauty castle is extremely small in comparison to the Magic Kingdom castle, and it doest not seem or feel like the focal point of the park. The park has some similar rights to Magic Kingdom like Peter Pan's flight, and Thunder Mountain. The other rides there are mostly extremely childish and while it may be fun for families, for young adolescents and adults who want to go, its quite boring. The only cool thing about the Disneyland park were the Villain characters that were out. We saw both the Snow White Queen and Cruella Devil which was pretty cool. Other than that, Disneyland was literally a smaller, less exciting version of Magic Kingdom. Disney's California Adventure also felt like it was more for kids than it was an all ages attraction. While there were definitely more rides at this park, and more geared towards adult as well like the roller coasters in the Pier, and the coaster in Cars, most of the rides were pretty basic. The Hollywood Tower of Terror was not as exciting as the one in Disney's Hollywood Studios at WDW. The Pier was the only redeeming park of California Adventure which was visually appealing. The rides there were cool too and it is nice at night with all the lights on. The Cars ride (can't remember the name, but the one where the two cars race) was a neat concept but I felt like the buildup to the actual race fell flat with the cars going only so fast.As a fan of WDW and all it has to offer, Disneyland definitely fell flat for both myself and my fianc  . Perhaps if Disneyland was the first Disney park we ever visited, it may have had more of an excitement for us.

We went on 3 rides in the California park then gave up as it was 1hr 30   for everything , walking down the streets were so stressful as there were people everywhere , still we were feeling optimistic as we were now going over to the main disney park for (3.30pm) We hadn't seen many characters in the first park and thought this may be because they were in the main park , we went over and there were 3 characters at the entrance , I managed to get a photo with Snow White and then we were mobbed , over 50 people around us in minutes!!

Before leaving we decided to complain at the main hall just before the exit , the man said the fire marshals control entry to the park , we insisted it was overcrowded and spoiled the park and he said that it was safe and they aren't letting any more in.

Since the recent ADA changes to the park the only magic that I experience is if I can get my electric scooter back to the car. Disney is under the incorrect impression that both parks are completely ADA compliant. Someone collecting a paycheck from Disney as an  ADA Professional  would best serve the Disney guests if he or she would return the unearned paychecks back to Disney. The parks are neither compliant nor easy to navigate either in a wheelchair, scooter or with a cane. The new ADA line system will never provide equal or fair access to any disabled guest. The new line system is discriminative and there is no proper procedure in place. Let me explain, there is no longer a guest assistance pass for the disabled. A disabled person is required to visit the customer care bldg at the front of the park to register verbally what the disability issue is. The cast member types into the computer the disability and places it within the guests ticket for that day or on the pass. The disabled person then is required to visit one of 4 booths within the Disneyland park to seek a 45 minute return pass for each and every ride. Think about this fact: you are disabled, probably not feeling as well as guests who do not suffer with a disability, you have to drive or push your wheelchair to a booth somewhere, get a return time and wait for 45 minutes, while feeling ill, to get on one ride. I was able to go on 3 rides in one day and in doing so my electric scooter died before I could return back to the parking structure to get to my car. Disney does not provide any electric wheelchair charging areas to facilitate the new line system that does not work! What did I do? I had my wife push me back to the parking structure.We waited for 30 minutes to even get a tram into the park because women took their baby strollers up onto the wheelchair ramp to get into the tram.The wheelchair ramp has an ISA for the disabled. Why does Disney staff allow strollers to take up wheelchair space?? A stroller must be empty and folded to even enter the tram. Why would the staff allow a stroller where it does not belong?

My grandchildren only saw the backs of the legs of the people standing in the crowd in front of them who were at a dead halt hoping to see the bands. It took us 2 hours to make it from the Castle down Main Street to the gate. If there had been any kind of emergency, we would all have been crushed by people trying to get out. You expect crowds at Disneyland if you've ever gone there before. I've worked in security and crowd control for years, and believe Disneyland did not have adequate crowd control plans or people to handle such an event.

My observation over the past few decades is that too many passes have been issued; too many rides are broken down; Plain food has a gourmet price tagged to it; and an average family can barely afford to go at all! It's plain and simple; Disneyland is geared to profit making on virtually every single event or product it offers.. Everything is tied completely to a profit magin of huge proportions and entertainment is only a sidebar. Disneyland had a great history and a true legend with it's creator Walt Disney. Slowly but surely they are fading away Walt's name and trying to create just  Disney . Most movie releases have only Disney in the logo; no more Walt. It's the sure sign that the genius and human touch of Walt is being replaced by a huge corporation that is riding on the history of Walt Disney, while at the same time dismissing the man and his honor and integrity.

We visited on December 29, 2014. The experience began with horrendous traffic and an infrastructure that was not built to handle the crowd heading to the park. Inside the park it was dangerously overcrowded. I truly feel that there is a safety issue for families with small children. We were seperated from each other more than a couple of times, as it was impossible to stay together in the extremely overcrowded conditions. Fortunately we did not have small children to keep track of. The lines were also unacceptably long, not only for the rides but to use the restroom as well. The wait times for some rides were over two hours. I am glad I was not there with a young child who would have been looking forward to visiting Disney. The disappointment would have been crushing. It made me very sad to see young families trying to make the best of their visit and trying to console crying children. Until this visit I had always believed Disney was all about giving everyone a truly wonderful experience. I guess I was just drinking the Kool Aid. My opinion of this company is very damaged.

It was about a 30 minute conversation to try to order a very simple cake. I had already waited on hold (long distance) for 45 mins to get through only to have more issues with order. He took all of my information including hotel, name, confirmation   AND my credit card information. He said he would then send me a confirmation email. Well I never did receive an email. I waited two weeks and called back. Same problem again, waited on hold for 30 minutes when finally someone picked up. I went through my whole issue with her and she seemed just as confused. She put me on hold about 6 times for minimum 5 6 minutes while she consulted with someone else. Finally she says there is no record of my order but she will follow through and speak to the hotel and bakery etc and call me back that same day. Surprise, NO call back. Who hires these people??? Why do they all seem to be brand new with no training?? Soooooo frustrating. So third time is the charm, NOT. I call back again today to try to track this order.

First of all, admission price for a family of four was certainly not cheap, but we did it for the children and we were looking forward to meeting lots of Disney characters to take photos with them and get signed autographs, and see the famous Disney parade at the end of the day, and if there were fireworks that would have been a great bonus. We bought our tickets online on the Disney website before flying over to the US and attended Disneyland on Friday October 10. The park was extremely crowded, even on a working day, with very long queues for all of the rides. Wait times on queues took 30 60 minutes just to clear, but we persevered. Then things started to go downhill. Queues to meet Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, etc were also very long, and by the time we got towards the front of the queue, we were told Mickey had to go for a break and will be back in 20 minutes. So that was wasted time queuing up. We decided to move on instead of wasting another 20 minutes for Mickey to return and figured we will come back to meet him again later in the day. Unfortunately this same thing happened with other characters as well and by the time we got around to coming back to find the characters we were told they had all finished for the day, so we only got to meet Minnie and Cinderella, and nobody else! We even bought a Disney autograph book at the start of the day and only got two signatures in it. But we tried not to let that ruin our day so we kept on trying to enjoy the rest of the park despite the huge crowds and long queue times. Unfortunately, that attempt to enjoy ourselves got cut short when it was announced the park was closing early that evening due to the Mickey Halloween Party and unless we had previously paid for the Halloween Party we were basically being kicked out early despite paying FULL ADMISSION PRICE for the day. As a result, we DID NOT get to see the Disney Parade nor any fireworks, which is what my daughter was mostly looking forward to. We left the park feeling very ripped off. I overheard several families around us also saying the early park closure was a shock and they also felt ripped off. I lodged a complaint to Disneyland and they said all the information around park closing times is shown on the website so it was basically  buyer beware . I made a point that it would have been more useful if the information was shown on the online ticketing webpage where people go to buy their tickets online because there was no such information shown. If I had seen such information, I would have certainly not chosen that Friday to attend the park. In the end, all they could offer me was a park revisit but that is useless as we have already returned to Australia. It didn't even occur to them to offer a partial refund as compensation. So in summary, you will still pay full price and not get the full Disney experience and they don't care. Very disappointed and combined with the long queues, overcrowdedness and the way they can just change hours on you and still keep all your money, Disneyland is not the happiest place on earth at all.

For example, the Haunted Mansion was once a great experience with the look and feel of a classic haunted house. Now, it looks more like a kid's toy store with brightly colored props and very tacky colors. It no longer has the look & feel of a classic haunted house. The Indiana Jones Adventure has also changed for the worse. In their attempt to pack more visitors in a shorter time, they removed at least one important experience, namely the part where he hangs from a rope and says  Back up!  Then, there was a large round boulder that would roll toward the vehicle; this has been removed, and all he does is hang by the rope with no rolling boulder. These are just two examples of how Disneyland has changed from a great theme park to something much more tacky.

That makes the weekend days literally packed to the point where you seriously cannot walk down the streets.Long lines. Not all rides have Fast Passes and some you would think should don't.Closed rides. We did not realize know that several major rides were closed. It's a Small World, Big Thunder Mtn, Splashdown, and finding Nemo were all closed at the same time? That left very little selection of the other popular rides which made the lines even worse.Rides breaking. It took 3 days for my parents to finally get on to Indiana Jones because ti kept breaking. I waited over 45 mins inside Indiana Jones while they tried to fix it. Pirates broken down as well while we were on it and waited 45 mins in the dark while they fixed. And Cars broke down too! It was crazy and disappointing not to mention wasted valuable vacation time to navigate the crowds and lines elsewhere.Travelling with kids and thinking you can do the switch out at the front of the line does not always work so be prepared to wait longer so everyone can do the rideNot as clean as it used to beEarly Morning entry did not include some major rides which was frustrating even though those rides are in the open sectionDid I mention long lines?Summary:I guess the condition of the park was surprising. Run down some. The staff still amazing.The food options limited due to closures.

829,211416128,1,2014-6,United States,"We took our 6 year old son to Disneyland (his first time) expecting it to be a magical experience for us all; unfortunately it was anything but magical. We planned and paid for our June trip in January, unaware that June 17 19 was the worst possible time to go. Upon our arrival the first day, we noticed an inordinate number of people...the lines to the rides were 45 minutes to over an hour, although the posted  wait time  was often only 5, 15, or 20 minutes. After the first 2 rides, we asked a Disney  cast member  about the long wait times and seriously large crowd, and she explained to us that this was due to the  day pass  holders trying to get in their last visit(s) before the passes expired...and she added that it would be better for us to come back but not on the 19th because that was  senior day  when all the 2014 grads would be there and it would be even worse. But, we were from out of town and had hotel rooms only through the 19th, so we were stuck. Since we had  fast passes,  we were naively optimistic in thinking that wait times for the 6 rides for which  fast passes  were available would not be an issue since the  fast pass  allows riders to return at an appointed time  with LITTLE or NO wait.  To me, NO waiting means that the riders would pass through the entrance to the ride and walk directly up to the loading area and LITTLE waiting would mean riders would enter and walk up toward the loading area, getting close enough to see people loading and would wait for only a few minutes before being placed on the loading platform or in a seat. Apparently this is not what  fast passes  do. Riders with fast passes approach the entrance to the ride where they may or may not enter immediately...once fast pass riders enter they may walk only a few feet or a few yards, stop and wait... then they eventually make it to the point where they give the fast pass to a Disney  cast member  who will often make them wait before continuing. After this, riders continue toward the loading area where they will again wait before finally loading. Granted, the entire  fast pass  process was faster than what the regular riders endured; however, it was not  LITTLE or NO wait.  We did get lucky on one of our fast passes for Star Tours and waited 14 minutes while the posted wait time was 20 minutes (but it was really close to twice that), but we still waited 70% of the posted time, which I do not consider a  LITTLE  wait. The remainder of our 3 day trip was spent waiting in long lines while watching people cut to join friends and family who had been saving them spots, dodging inconsiderate or inattentive park guests and their stroller wheels as we made our way from ride to ride like salmon swimming upstream, witnessing people enter through exits and then hop the rope railing, and watching rides depart with anywhere from 1 to 4 empty seats time and time again. The one and only time we rode the Matterhorn during our 3 days, we counted enough empty seats in 5 consecutive rides, that an entire ride was wasted. That kind of inefficiency only infuriates people who are trying to wait patiently and enjoy a long awaited vacation in the  magical kingdom . As far as  senior day  goes, it WAS worse. Huge hoards of seniors travelled en masse throughout the park, oftentimes stopping abruptly for no apparent reason and blocking the thoroughfare. They were bay far the worst for line cutting and exit entering. (But we also saw plenty of adults  with their children doing the same.) When we told them not to cut because it wasn't fair to all of us who had been waiting following the rules, they would either glare, ignore, or roll their eyes at us, call us jerks, or try to intimidate us into backing down by puffing up their chest, planting their feet, and staring. When we brought it to the attention of the Disney  cast members  that all this was going on, we were told that they (Disneyland) were doing all they could do to ensure an enjoyable experience for everyone, but that it was hard to catch offenders in the act because there just wasn't enough security to monitor every ride, adding they too did not approve of  senior day  because of the unruly graduates and that the only way to change the situation was to make a formal complaint at Disney's City Hall. So that's what we did. While our complaint was acknowledged and filed, we were politely informed that senior day happens every year and the date is posted on the website, but not as far in advance as January when we made our vacation plans. We, as older parents, have visited Disneyland countless times (as children, teens, and adults,) yet we have never once experienced anything as disappointing as we did on this last trip. Luckily our son didn't know any better since this was his first experience at Disneyland; however he did remark that during our 6 days at Lagoon in Salt Lake City the wait time for rides was basically nonexistent in comparison. We will return to Disneyland, but we will make sure it is well before day passes expire, California schools are out for the summer, and seniors get their  special day  at the park.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

Our last few visits have been okay, nothing stellar, but after our visit this year, I think I'm finally ready to hang up my Mickey ears. We visited the first week of June and were surprised to see that Space Mountain was down for refurbishment. Why wouldn't that take place during the off season? In addition, there were prolonged breakdowns of Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain during the ONE DAY we visited. So we headed over to California Adventure, only to find that California Screamin' and the new Radiator Springs Racers were also down for part of the day, and Grizzly River Run was closed for refurbishment. If I am now paying $150 for a one day park hopper ticket, I have some expectations that the rides will at least be working. With all the big rides down, everyone was funneled into the smaller rides, so lines were extremely long.We expected Disneyland to be crowded, but it was absolutely bursting at the seams, and every pathway was congested by 11:00 a.m. We had planned to stay and watch Fantasmic, but the crowds just became too much, and we left at 7:00 p.m. The overall cleanliness of the park left something to be desired as well, with dirty bathrooms the norm, and trash noticed along Main Street. The quality of the merchandise has gone downhill, too, as we found nothing worth purchasing in any of the stores. My daughter was particularly disappointed that there was absolutely no Olaf merchandise (from Frozen), which you think would have been everywhere.

We were able to ride almost everything. I would never ever recommend someone go to Disneyland without a plan set out. We saw only 2 characters during our 14 hour visit. They clearly do not have any kind of crowd control going on because it was busier there than Disney World at Christmas! The employees are not as friendly as the cast members at Disney World. In fact a few times they were just downright rude. As we got our hands stamped to leave an employees said to my son,  Hey KID, its THIS WAY!  and thats just not what you get at Disney World. The cast members there (disney world) are taught to treat customers with respect even if they are small. It was not magical and it was way over crowded. You'd think that for as much as they charge to get in, they could manage the crowds a little better. If you hate crowds you will definitely want to skip Disneyland. We were at the front of the line at rope drop and we went straight to Peter Pan's flight and the line was already wrapped around the building. It was total Chaos there. During the parades you are shoulder to shoulder. Once you've been to Disney World, Disneyland is just one big let down. We got to the fireworks an hour early and had to sit almost all the way to the buildings on main street and then we walked straight to fantasmic and there was no seating left. The employee we encountered there was also rude. If you want the experience of Disney but can't make it to Disney World then by all means go just make sure you go EARLY and have a plan (I suggest ridemax).

We went to pizza plaza, and they were closing at 10:00. I entered at 9:45 and you could visibly see the staff was not happy about that. The pizza was cold. Most of the other counter entrees were closed. Most disturbing was the attitudes of the staff. The floor looked like it hadn't been swept all day. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, the staff attitudes are the same among the employees throughout the park. I felt like I was at islands of adventure when schools were taking their trips. Although there were many families there,MIT was overrun with obnocious teenagers and everything was out of control. The cast could care less on the rides while they are part of the experience in Florida. Who was yawning, and who Was yelling at kids not to do certain things seemed to be the run of of the day.

Does the cost of just getting into the park justify the experience... Just barely. Bring your own food and understand that the math is not in your favor. I.e. I drove from Arizona with my family of 4 and didn't have to pay for a hotel, in conclusion (and being very frugal) we rode 15 rides, dived that by the cost of everything (gas, tickets, parking, food, very little souvenirs) the total expense per ride was $42 a pop.

Probably the worst thing was the  Magic Morning . We anticipated no lines for one hour before the park opened to the general public. Well, everyone else had magic morning passes too it seemed and to our horror, all early morning customers were funneled into Fantasy Land as the rest of the park was closed. The crowds were crushing! We stood in line 40 minutes for Peter Pan, but when it was almost our turn they suddenly shut the ride down due to technical difficulties! Our  magic morning  turned into a  miserable morning . We then went to adventure land and waited for 15 minutes for them to open the gates so we could be first in line to ride Big Thunder Mountain, then we dashed over only to find it was closed due to technical difficulties!

I have visited Disneyland twice before, once 25 years ago and then again with my husband 7 years ago so I certainly have something to compare this visit with. My husband and I had a two day pass 7 days ago and we got around all of the rides on the first day and went back the 2nd day to ride the ones that we really loved another time or two. One of the rides that we loved was Space Mountain with its fast rollercoaster and scenery of the Universe. I think we did it 3 times back then. Well...those days are over.The crowds are so dense right from the long wait first thing in the morning as you queue to get your bags checked and then queue again to get your ticket checked. Took us over an hour to get in the gate and the same thing happened on the Magic morning pass   queuing for over an hour just to get in and this is supposed to be a quieter time! Once in, more crowds, so dense that walking along the pathways is reduced to the speed of the crowd. Strollers and buggies clog up the walkways as we tried to navigate between them to get our fastpasses. We managed two Fastpasses on the first day but the third one required us to return 5 hours later in order to use it and the standard queues at the rides had reached around 1 1 2 hours standing time so on the first day we only tried out 3 rides and gave up in the end.The next day, even with the magic morning pass, the queue for the Matterhorn Bobsleds was over an hour once we got off our first ride and the queue for The Cars ride was an hour and a half. I don't know what happened to the Space Mountain ride since the last time we were on it but we had the initial Warp type laser set up and then we were in pitch black for the whole of the 3 minute rollercoaster ride...what a fizzer. On the third day we decided that we would head straight for the Indiana Jones ride that had been closed for maintenance for a couple of weeks and had opened again the day before. We grabbed a Fast Pass but it still took around 35 minutes of queuing to get on the ride. The other main queue for this ride was sitting around an hour and a half. Once on the ride it was all fun and games until about three quarters of the way through when it broke down and we sat in the jeeps for about 10 minutes while they tried to fix it. No good though so the ride was closed down and the huge long queue of people waiting all had to reverse direction and head back out....what a waste of their time! Trying to get between parks to book Fast Passes and then return for the rides became so onerous and exhausting with the packed throughways that we gave up and left Disneyland without having been on all of the rides and well and truly over the place. We would not recommend it to anyone even after having done so for years and we would certainly not go back.Disney Management needs to take a serious look at the number of people that they pack through into the parks now and set some limits in order to enable people to be able to enjoy the rides without having the long queue times. Ridiculous to have to queue for 1 hour   1 1 2 hours for a 3 minute ride which basically means queuing the whole time you are there to enjoy about 20   30 minutes of rides in total for a day. Maximum numbers need to be set and then more people allowed in only once some have left.

I asked numerous  cast members  if the time was a good time to go and every one of them replied with an enthusiastic  YES!  It turns out it was as crowded as the times I have visited in June and July in the past. Though the rides and shows were as magical as ever we spent three days there and weren't able to do half of what we wanted because it was so packed. The food was substandard and some of the cast members were less than friendly. It is sad because it seems that all things Disney have strayed far from the original goal of Walt Disney. It now appears to be more about the money, for an already wealthy big business, than the magic. I understand the concept of supply and demand and that if it were super cheap then it would be even more over crowded but how about limiting the number of visitors per day. One of the cast members told us that capacity for Disneyland alone was 80,000 aprox. that is insane . It was not yet at capacity, because they were not turning people away at the gates, and we could not walk down the street in a group. people were irritable and at times rude because we were trying to do what everyone else was doing which was to get through the crowds. I do not feel like we got our money's worth because of the number of things we did not get to do and the food was not what I would consider typical Disney quality it was however much more expensive than what I remember paying 3 years ago. This all makes me very sad because for me Disney has always been magical. I enthusiastically counted down the days to our trip with the kids only to be so let down. I hate to say that Disney has really lost the magic for me. The curtain was pulled back and the true motive of Disney revealed.

Yes, it had been 16 years since we had last visited,  the happiest place on earth,  but we did not expect how awful our experience would be. First, when I bought the tickets as part of staying at the Disneyland Hotel, the person on the phone should have told me that Friday, May 16th, was Grad Night. Thousands and thousands of unescorted 17 and 18 years olds filling every possible space on the entire property   misbehaving as only 17 and 17 year olds know how to misbehave. IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY THAT WE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE. Second, the park was filthy and the rides have not been cleaned in a long time. For example, the bar you would automatically hold during the ride on the Matahorn was so disgustingly dirty, we had no interest in holding the bard. Not surprisingly, we heard various people complaining as we exited the ride. Also, the bruises I got because I was not able to hold on were certainly not worth the experience. Third, it is so clear that Disney only cares about making money. Several of the rides were closed and others had a 90 MINUTE WAIT.

Went later on in the day waited 40 minutes got to the entrance ride broke down again. Areas of the park closed for beautification. But above all it lacked the magical experience we have become used to with Disney.Cast members seemed disinterested. Is it not time to replace Captain EO. Played to theatre which was a quarter full.

It was crowed and hot. They kept announcing that the ride would start in a little bit. So more and more people came out of the elevator, and it got more crowded and even hotter.The bottom line was it was about an hour before they admitted it wasn't going to run, they apologized, and promised everybody some kind of Disney Bucks, that didn't happen either.We did find some rides that worked and some good places to eat, that rescued the day.I do recommend the Soft Pineapple Ice Cream at the Tiki Room, Delicious.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

860,204861722,2,2014-2,United States,"For a family of four spending $800 for ONE DAY at a park, there should be a lot of rides to be experienced. Sadly, five rides in one day does not cut it. It was extremely disappointing. The Jungle Cruise, usually a 10 minute wait, was an hour. I'm a Southern California resident so I know this park like the back of my hand. My husband and I experienced a first while waiting in line for this ride. Seriously, in the 100 plus times I've been on this ride, I've never gone UPSTAIRS and INTO another building while waiting in line. This is absurd. Splash Mountain was closed. Star Tours and Indiana Jones both had 90  minute waits. REALLY? IT GETS WORSE. THERE WAS A LINE for Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (the exhibit that NEVER has a line). Needless to say, it was almost a total waste of $800. We did end up just going down Main Street and checking out every store because we just wanted to get away from the mass of humanity. I hate to complain but there are things that have changed at Disneyland.My biggest complaint, and one that Disney can't do anything about, is that modern technology has made walking through the park a painful experience. I was constantly getting run into or my toes stepped on because people (young and old alike) were too busy looking down at their SmartPhones instead of looking at where they were going. When it's VERY CROWDED, this is a HUGE problem. I ended up with a torn toenail (I was wearing closed toe shoes) because some idiot walked right into me and scoffed the top of my foot with his hiking boot.ANOTHER PROBLEM: While we waited 30 minutes to buy our tickets, my husband's credit card was declined. Turns out the credit card company thought there was some suspicious activity on the card and temporarily suspended it. While my husband was on the phone talking with the credit card company, the window where we were trying to buy tickets closed. I asked the security guard if we had to go to another line and wait again. Yep, we did. The credit card company re activated my husband's credit card and we had to wait another 30 minutes in another line. The whole time my husband was fuming at a seemingly uncaring security guard. Come on, Disney. This is bad customer service. So is allowing these double wide strollers into the park, ESPECIALLY when there is a parade going on. You can't move around well and you get rammed by these strollers because the parents pushing them don't have any perspective.Food wise, it was better than usual. We ate at the Bengal BBQ (across from Jungle Cruise) and the spicy kebabs were surprisingly good. Yes, one kebab won't fill you up, but we ordered a bunch of different stuff and were very happy with the quality. It is not typical Disney fare. Finally. props to the cast members at Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean. The lines were long but the line was constantly moving, which is a good thing. The wait was about 45 minutes for each ride. Food wise, I HIGHLY recommend the kebabs at Bengal Barbecue. Also, the burgers at Taste Pilot (California Adventure) are good. If you have the luxury of making reservations and want a real Disney experience, eat a Monte Cristo (at $25, it's the cheapest entree on the menu) at the Blue Bayou. Note: for a family of four, you won't get out of here for less than a $100. If you can afford to splurge, eat at Napa Rose at California Adventure. It's outstanding. Local resident tip: If you happen to visit this park in December, don't miss the ride It's a Small World. They change all of the doll's costumes to reflect a winter theme. ALSO... check out the fire station on Main Street with your little ones.

Yet the ticket prices were the same high prices. Sad to say but despite lots of things to credit the park on this is no longer value for money. Too expensive to have so many rides out of action at the same time and all the other ones including some of the newer rides (like Cars) breaking down and being closed for long periods during the day.Also a hint if you are just going for the fireworks display, then save your money, and go to an Angels game on a Saturday night.

I have 3 small children, not babies but ages 4 8, it is really hard to keep them happy walking in the heat, waiting lonnnnngggggg lines for every ride. I have a son with a disability, and the past 2 years it was easier with the handicap pass to wait in line, but this year everything is different, they changed everything, so people with disabilities, they have to wait in the sun, like everyone else, they give you this small book and you can ask for a ride one at a time, waiting 1 to 2 hours to go to that ride and Still wait for about 15 min in the heat. Another thing they changed, before, we could go with our son in small parties, maximum 6 per handicap person. Now, it seems like they can put dozens in one party, so, waiting time is longer. I really don't know if we are coming back to Disney, I don't think is worth the price or the effort.

866,204210691,2,2014-5,United States,"It pains me to write this review. As a child, neither my husband nor I ever got to visit neither Disneyland nor Walt Disney World. 30 years later we spent months planning and saving to take our 4 year old and 2 year old to Disneyland. To say I was excited would be putting it mildly. Both my husband and I were so disappointed. We were in the park April 29 May 2, Disneyland's  off season.  Wow, if that is the off season I can't even imagine what a busy season is like. The crowds were absolutely horrible. Crowds don't bother me but it was just horrible in the parks. The wait times were unbelievable. It really sucks the  magic  out of the vacation when your toddler and preschooler tell you how much fun they had on a ride and you have to tell them it will be another 45 min   1 hour wait before they can get on another ride and experience that 2 minutes of  magic  again. Opening was absolute chaos. People were pushing and shoving, knocking children over, and running like animals. I got ran over by a stroller more than once. There has to be a better way to handle opening. We had a magic morning and it was the worst day, it was of no benefit. Many rides were closed (more than listed on their website) and or broke down several times.The weather was very hot (record temps for April May), totally out of Disney's control, however we overheard workers commenting on how Disney raised the price on water. Really, come on, do you want families to have a good time (and stay hydrated) or do you want to squeeze every single dollar you can out of them? We didn't personally notice because we brought our own water every day. Bring your own water!The line to meet the Frozen characters was crazy. My 4 year old loves Frozen, we reenact the movie every day, we sing the songs, we watch the movie   she's obsessed. It was a must do for us. The day we set aside to meet them they opened at 10am. We had Magic Morning at 9am. We lined up at the entrance at 8:15am. We were respectful and walked (not ran, not knocked over children, not pushed and shoved) straight there. We finally met them at noon. In the 2 hours from the Frozen meet and greet opening until we met them they took 3 breaks. The line is in complete sun and moves at a snail's pace. At noon the wait time was over 4 hours. The character interaction was very good I must say, but again being Disney and having done this for how many years, isn't there more of an efficient way?We did two character dining   breakfast at Ariel's Grotto and Surf's Up with Mickey. I will post separate reviews but briefly   Ariel's was pretty good. Surf's Up was pretty good but I was disgusted at one point. We had purchased an autograph book but I forgot it in the hotel room. My daughter was so sad. I asked for a piece of paper or even the back for a receipt to get some signatures to paste in the book. They refused to give us anything and instead suggested we go and buy another autograph book. Paying $96 for breakfast and they can't spare a piece of paper? Wasn't Walt's vision for a nice place for families to spend time together. An experience like this just drives home the fact that they are trying to squeeze every dollar out of guests and not create an experience. We left with a very disappointed 4 year old! We had to spend time in line at Mickey's house to get an autograph, shouldn't have had to do that when we paid nearly $100 for breakfast. There were some things that were done very well. The Disney Jr. Live on Stage show at California Adventure was awesome, a must see. The parades (both at DL & DCA) were great. Fireworks were good. The Toy Story Mania ride at DCA was really fun (long wait first thing in the morning though).I would not recommend Disneyland for toddlers or preschoolers.

We were there with a 3 day park hopper.We went what we thought was slow period after Easter break. That was not the case. First day we were there, the park was very crowded and filled with locals. The park opened at 8 :00 am. We arrived at 7:15 am. Good thing we did. The crowds and lines of people at the gate were horrible.Secondly, the rat race to get to the rides at park opening was absolutely horrible. People were literally running with their children so they could go to the ride of their choice so they wouldn't have to wait in line    and they also ran to the fast pass machines as well. If i had known this was a marathon I would have packed my running clothes. Fast pass machines ran out of tickets in 20 minutes. THe wait times for standby were absolutely terrible later in the afternoon.The sheer amount of strollers and parents who bring their infants    is just overwhelming. They are parked all over   . very hard to squeeze through strollers with screaming children and crowds.Wait times for the Frozen princesses   if you are looking to do that    have daily wait times of 3 4 hours. In turn you see hundreds of tired, crabby, children waiting for hours. Very poorly run. You would think Disney would plan it out better.We experienced much of the same on the other side at California Adventure    their most popular ride is Radiator Springs Cars ride. We had to run to that ride   .because the daily wait times vary from 1.5  3 hrs. While standing in line the ride did stop    it broke down, they got it up and running, however that pushed the morning wait time to over an hour first thing.Unfortunately if you want a low wait time for this ride, your only choice is stay at a resort property and have a magic morning at California Adventure. Otherwise   . the fast pass for the regular patrons is gone very quickly and standby times are very long. If you are a single ride    waits can be from 45 60 min.On our last day at Disneyland we had a magic morning. It was probably the worst of the 3 days. The crowds were huge, the rat race started all over again. People running etc. Only half the park was opening for magic morning. Adventureland and Frontierland was closed. You pay all money for tickets and you have a magic morning   . how about opening the whole park!!! By closing off the 2 areas   . it got even more crowded    and there were more races.

We have been to Disneyland and Disney World in previous years, when the kids were younger, and man, what has happened? Over population I guess. It's now just a crowded, run down, big amusement park. We paid extra money (regret it) to stay at a so called on resort hotel ( honestly some Best Westerns are closer than the Disney resorts) so we could take advantage of the extra Magic Hour. What Disney does not state on their web site, nor do the hotels, is that most of the park is closed during this  extra magic hour . So we still end up waiting in line ups. Fantasy Land is the only section open during this time. So Frontier land, Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land you will get to go in at the same time as the rest of the public who are NOT paying $400 a night and more. So you feel like a sucker. We were disappointed that Indiana Jones ride was closed for refurbishment as were other rides. If your Park Hopper Pass doesn't have a photo ID, bring one to enter the park, they will hassle you about seeing photo ID ( it does not state on the pass that you will need photo ID) Also don't forget your room key if you are staying at the resort hotel and are going for that so called extra hour. Washroom: very few in the Disney Park, California Adventure Land is better set up and overall a much cleaner park.Line jumpers. Pretty ugly behaviour we witnessed from mothers with toddlers and young kids. We couldn't believe it. They would just walked through the line, not offering any explanation, just kept walking and jump on the ride. I think people were too bewildered to say anything. And it happened in every line up we were in. Employees don't seem to care or bother controlling this. Basically uneducated staff. Clueless.  So Disneyland, let me ask you this, with the loads of cash you're making, don't you think you could pay a few more people to pose as princesses and characters in the Park? 3 to 4 hour long waits to see the Frozen Characters!!?? What a scam. And parents too stupid to walk away with their little kids, who end up crying in line from fatigue and being hot. Unreal. Couldn't there be 4 or 5 stations around the park with these characters?? Instead of making it exclusive like that? Crazy!! Oh and be ready for the sea of strollers. They take up more than half the park. Strollers everywhere! Do you think your babies will remember this experience? No. Leave your babies at home with sitters everyone will be happier.Everyone grows up with the image of Disneyland being magical. Princesses walking around smiling and greeting kids. Doesn't happen. They make the castle look huge and grand. The castle will be your first disappointment. It's not a castle. It's pretty much a covered walk way. You walk through it. There are no rooms, nothing to see. And it's way way smaller than on tv. There were no fireworks any of the evenings we were there.

At allmost every line someone would cut in front, and the employees just watched. It was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait 40 minutes, then have to watch (typically locals) people just step in front at the last second. If you say anything, you make a scene if front of your kids. If you dont, you are not a good role model. I didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that...the employees should.

877,201724484,2,2014-4,United States,"My husband and I got married in the beginning of April in the Anaheim area. To celebrate our wedding we visited Disneyland CA. Our family was already in the park, when we arrived. When we tried to enter (and after we already paid of course) we were stopped by a Disney employee who uttered some words about a problem with my flowers. I thought maybe they are afraid of my flowers carying a disease that infects their plants? Anyways, a special guy (I call him the bringer of bad news guy, what an awful job) was called in and it turns out that the    real    problem was that we looked too much like prince and princess! Okay, pretty nice compliment, but not great when you look at the consequences. The guy said that in our wedding attire, we would be 'distracting' from the Disney show. So we weren't really supposed to go into the park. Okay... Not such a great start of the day, as we were waiting there for 15 minutes or more before we were even informed of this. And then the guy asked us if we brought extra clothes so we could change in regular attire etc. Of course we were not carrying any other clothes with us! I was looking forward to making pictures with my new husband in front of the pink castle in my nice dress and him with his suit, and I could see myself showing a picture to my future grandchildren, sitting in a scary ride with my wedding dress on and holding my flowers in the air, but no ... that was apparently not possible. So we told the guy we really wanted to go inside, so I suggested to wear a sweater over my dress and he finally agreed that we could enter the park if I wore my sweater, my scarf and if my husband was carrying my flowers. Well, it was chilly anyway, so I didn't mind wearing the sweater, because I thought it was good that we at least got to go into the park, as our family members already paid for their tickets and were waiting for us. However, it was a big disappointment that I couldn't take fun pictures with our full attire showing on the pictures. But, to us, it was more important to get into the park than to make a fuss over it.When we walked into the park, my husband and I discussed why Disneyland would have such a strange policy regarding people coming to celebrate their wedding. My husband thought that Disneyland was afraid of being sued if we would be rude to the children who actually thought we were a prince and princess. I thought it had something to do with all the ads I had seen online, where Disneyland is trying to sell wedding packages (then you have the ceremony and the party in the park), so I thought that maybe they don   t want other newlywed couples to    free ride    and be able to take pictures in the park if they don't pay for the full package? I know that in the Efteling, an amazing Dutch theme park that won several awards for being the best theme park in the world, loves having married couples taking pictures in their park. They even let newly weds in for free, because it   s like free publicity for them to see their theme park show up in happy wedding pictures. Also, in the minds of those newlyweds your park is forever linked to the greatest day in their lives. On top of that, people in the park always seem happy to see newlyweds, so it makes for a great experience for everyone, really. In Disneyland, too, people were happy for us and congratulating us. And yes, one girl came up to us and asked if we got married (she did NOT ask whether we were a prince and princess). When we said that was the case, she hugged us and then walked on.My husband had to make a business phone call and so we sat down on a bench. Then a group of about 8 Disney employees comes walking towards us. One older lady tells us that she has received complaints from customers about our behavior. She says that I had taken my sweater off and posed for pictures. She added that they caught us on camera, too. I was really taken aback. I felt really hurt that another customer would have said something like that about us, while it was not true! So unjust! So I told her that a girl did hug me, but that was because she congratulated us with our marriage, and that I never took my sweater off! The woman kept insisting that I did take my sweater off, that we had done something wrong and that we may have to leave the park. I finally said: well, show us the video then. And another employee was joking in a nice way: yes, let   s watch the video. I then suggested they take the flowers away. One other employee asked whether I didn   t want them. I said: of course I want to keep my wedding bouquet, but if I am not allowed to stay in Disneyland, then I will gladly give it up! Then I was allowed to keep it (well, my husband had to carry it still) and they backed down a little bit. When they walked off, one of the employees, a younger girl said that I looked gorgeous. That was nice, but I felt really hurt and distraught at that moment. It was mainly the older woman being mean, helped by the bringer of bad news. But the other employees were half heartedly following the older woman around (her orders, I guess), as I could see they thought it was ridiculous too. The young girl later came up to me and sort of apologized and gave us buttons that said    just married    and some fast track passes. I felt so touched by her trying to make up that all of a sudden I had to cry (and I don   t cry often). It was all the emotions of the day, and then a guest complaining and those Disney employees being so mean. My husband thinks the Disney employee might have been lying about the video images and the complaint coming from a customer, just to pressure us to say that that is what we did.Anyway, trying to get into Disneyland was a really bad part of our day. I wouldn   t recommend it. Celebrate somewhere else. Until Disneyland changes their policy.And why can only children dress up? If I want to be princess for a day, you know when you feel like dressing up and being a kid again, wouldn   t Disneyland be the place to do that? Well, apparently not    Sad. Other than that we had a great day with our family. Some of the employees, especially the photographers were funny and friendly. The rides are nice, but since I can compare to Disneyland Paris, I would say to the Europeans: don   t travel all the way to California to do the rides. They are more or less the same in Paris. And the rides for the small ones, like Snow White and Peter Pan are actually set for a speed that makes it hard to see anything or follow the story! If I remember right, the rides are set to a slower pace in Paris. Also, the Anaheim park seems more busy than the Paris park (we went on a regular weekday), but the lines were not too long (I don't think waiting 15 30 min is long). The only thing that   s definitely better in California than Paris is the weather and the prices of food and drinks are not too bad for a theme park (although Americans would probably say it is too expensive).",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

Maybe it was the week we were there, I am not sure but they were not the way you would expect Disney staff to act, I even heard a group of them standing around talking about their personal lives instead of interacting with guests. I expect this from other parks but never Disney. Almost all the major rides were closed so most of the attractions my daughter could go on, Small world, Ariel, etc. she was not able.

881,200717447,2,2014-4,United States,"I can't believe I'm giving Disney a poor rating. My family and I LOVE everything Disney!My first trip to Disneyland was in 1978   I was 10. It was the greatest place I had ever been. I went back in the early 80's and once again had a great time. This time was a let down.Why was it a let down? The only thing I can say is after 20  visits to Disney World I was expecting the same experience at Land. Disneyland is small and poorly operated.Here are some examples:Disney World $134   1 day park hopper   includes 4 parks Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood StudiosDisneyland $137   1 day park hopper   includes Disneyland and California AdventureMagic Kingdom is the closest to Disneyland so my comparison will be to MK.During the fireworks the castle pass through closes but most rides remain open at MK. We've been on the Dumbo ride during the fireworks   going off right over us.DL there were several rides closed   because of lines they close 1 hour before   losing about 1 1 2 hours of ride time. You can't be in line during the fireworks. The castle pass through was also closed.There are a couple of different parades at MK. The day parade which happens two times during the day and then the Electric Light Parade at night. DL had one parade that took place twice   4PM and 6:30PM.Disneyland does have a couple of rides that DW doesn't have. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was taken out of DW a couple of years ago. Unfortunately we tried to get in line just about an hour before the fireworks and it was closed   the guide didn't say it closes. We did ride Storybook Land Canal Boats. Note: they also close during the fireworks but the guide states it closes.A couple of rides that DW doesn't have are: Matterhorn Bobsleds   the line was 60 minutes long and no fast pass, Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, and Indiana Jones Adventure   they were all closed for refurbishment. Not sure how long they have been closed or will be closed but it seems an odd time (spring break) to close rides. Small World was also closed along with Snow White's Adventure.Another complaint. When you purchase tickets to a Disney park you would think they could keep the characters out longer. Elsa and Anna were only available in DL from 9AM   3:30PM. The Fairies were 9AM   3:15PM and Merida was 9AM   3PM. The Princesses were 9AM   7PM. Even if we only did these characters the lines were so long we would have missed the majority of the park.The Royal Theater according to the DL website have a Tangled Show and a Beauty and the Beast show. There were no shows the day we visited. There was a greeter saying the theater was closed.Some things I found odd: asked for directions and the man pointed with one finger   so against Disney rules   always two or more fingersAsked an elderly worker a question and he was so grumpy. My question was do we have time to look around since it's a 20 minute wait or should we get in line right now? His response,  you have time but if you're even a second late I'm not letting you in . You would NEVER get a response like that at DW.Sleeping Beauty's castle is SO tiny. Not a big deal but......We watched the Mickey and the Magical Map show and that was very entertaining.Another good point of DL is Mickey and Minnie Mouse were out dancing on Main Street. You NEVER see them out of their tent in Fantasyland or in the parade at MK. You can see them at Animal Kingdom more easily.All in all our day was 3 out of 10.

We arrived shortly after the park opened and parked in the Woody lot. we then had to wait in line to get on a shuttle, about 30 minutes. After the 5 minute ride to the park, we waited in another line to have our bags inspected. This was an absolute joke. After the  security  check, we had to wait in yet another line to get into the park, about 10 minutes. We decided to head to California Adventure and get a fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers. By this point, the park had been open for about an hour and the fast passes were gone for the day. We could wait in line for about an hour and a half if we wanted to ride it, but we still had 2 more days. We'd just get there earlier the next day and gt a fast pass. We found a few rides with short lines, mostly in the  Bugs Life , but those 1 2 minute rides still had waits of 20 minutes. We rode 3 rides at California Adventure in 90 minutes then decided to head over to Disneyland. Waited in another line there to get in, then had to wait to do the classic picture at the entrance. The first ride we went to, the Peter Pan ride took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get through the line, waiting on the 85 degree sun. Then the ride was 2 minutes long at the most. We rode the Autotopia ride next, another hour wait. By this point we had been at the park for about 6 hours total and the kids were done. We checked into our hotel, Courtyard by Marriott Anaheim at Disneyland Resort great place to stay for cheap, and rested up for the next day. We go to the park 30 minutes before they opened the next day and waited in 2 more lines to get into California Adventure to get our Fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers. By the time we got in line, it was almost 1 4 mile long. That is no exaggeration. Waited in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a ticket that says to come back in 6 7 hours and wait in line again. So we went and rode a few more rides and came back to Radiator Springs at our appointed time. When we arrived, the ride was temporarily closed and were told to check back periodically. So we had to stay in California Adventure. After a couple of hours, they decided to close the ride for the rest of the day. Then we had to go wait in line at guest relations to get our name on a list so we could come back the next day and get a pass to ride. This part of Disneyland was great. We gave them our name and when we came back the next day, we picked up a pass for 6 people to get on the ride. There were only 4 of us and only 2 could ride at a time (my daughter is too small). We picked up a family of 4 waiting in line for a fast pass and took them with us. Got right on with no wait and then did the rider swap and got right back on again. Star Tours was another great experience. We got the fast pass earlier then waited only a short while to ride. As the doors opened for us to get on the ride, my son said he needed to go potty. When he says that, there is no holding it, so we went to the bathroom and got a pass to bypass the line and get back on with no waiting. Other than that, Disneyland was a disappointment. The lines and crowds are too much. I would constantly hear from other people in passing,  this is ridiculous, it's just not worth it .

899,193206139,2,2014-2,United States,"Disneyland is now crowded all the time. Really crowded. Even on the slowest days.Being a fan of amusement parks and in Disney in particular, I researched the historically least crowded days to attend, and threw the dart at February 4th, 2014. But when I arrived, I was shocked to see queue lines snaking into the midways, a sea of strollers, and a two hour wait time for the newest attraction in Cars Land, and even a half a block long line to get a Fast Pass for Radiator Springs, the newest and best attraction. Makes you wonder what in the world will the parks be like on a busy day. Certainly not worth $100, or $130 for two parks. Recently a Huffington post article complaining about the overcrowding showed a shocking picture of the sea of people at Disneyland, crowding the streets, shoulder to shoulder. Reports say Disney often tops out at 80,000 guests. Clearly, there aren't enough attractions to accommodate that number. There's not even enough room for every guest to sit down. And all these reviews here talking about how  wonderful  and  beautiful  the place is are completely ignoring the huge pink elephant in the room. Overcrowding is so bad, it's likely that Guest Relations would receive an enormous number of complaints from guests not even able to see a minimal number of attractions.The line for the newest attraction, Radiator Springs was 2 hours long. More sobering, the line just to sign up for a fast pass reservation time snaked nearly half a block long! A couple of hours later, the fast pass reservation system closed for Radiator Springs   there weren't enough reservation times available.Now when there aren't enough reservation times available to accommodate the guests who have paid $130 to see your park's major attractions, it raises a basic question. What are guests getting for $130? Are they being guaranteed a ride on any of the rides? Are they being guaranteed a ride on the newest attraction at Cars Land? Really, the answer is no. You're not guaranteed a ride on any of the rides, although a Fast Pass helps insure a minimal number of rides, the old halcyon days of multiple re rides on a single attraction, or riding every ride in the park are gone.Looks like from a business standpoint, Disney is going to have to make some decisions about what constitutes an acceptable experience for $130.Having said all that, here are the accolades the place deserves.Cars Land's Radiator Springs is an American triumph in entertainment. The animated characters are so likeable, and the Arizona Red Rocks ride so beautifully rendered, and the ride so thrilling, it is a truly a world class amusement ride experience. Maybe the best character based ride in the history of the Amusement park industry. It's that good.The restaurants in the hotels delivered unfailingly good appetizers and entrees. Really impressive food in the Napa Rose, and in the California themed hotel's bar.On this, one of the least crowded days of the year, I was able to sneak in 6 rides on Radiator Springs in the park's final hour by using the single rider queue. And some wait times during the day hovered din the 20 to 30 minute category. But nothing like what it used to be on a slow day.

The queues were ridiculously long   the wait time for the Indiana Jones ride at 10.30am was 2 hours! The free pass system is a joke. We used it to bypass the queue for Indiana Jones and were given a time between 1pm and 2pm to return to ride. We couldn't then use the free pass again until half of that time had elapsed, so we couldn't prebook other rides until 11.30am!

It sounds good in concept: A family celebration that includes the children. But it was a massive fire and safety hazard. Walking in redirected crowds (nearly all places were  re directed ) meant that all parts of your body were touching strangers on every side. At some points the crowds were so compact I was nearly lifted off my feet. I have spent New Years Eve in Times Square and been to one of the most crowded Mardi Gras in New Orleans history and neither compared to the chaos and crowds of Disneyland on New Years Eve. I waited an hour for a locker at 8am. Every bathroom line was a minimum of a half hours wait and the rides were often two hours. It was $30 for a lunch of two hot dogs, drinks and chips. And every employee seemed miserable to have to spend their NYE working. The worst part were all the detours. I cannot begin to recount the number of times my desired destination was 20 feet away albeit across Main Street and I was redirected around the entire circumference of the park to get there. I'm certain I walked a half marathon at least and made about 8 trips around the entire park. Many attractions closed down after waiting in long lines and that included lines to greet characters. Twice our child waited in line over 30 mins to meet Goofy only to have him leave as she was next in line. Two moments of magic worth mentioning: the phenomenal fire works display and the disco music playing loudly through the park once evening began. Imagine 1 million people all clapping their hands in unison to the song, CAR WASH and dancing in lines. That was pretty fun and memorable. The cover band was also impressive.

This is my narrow view of my first and only visit to Disneyland based on a 2 day visit after New Years 2014.You know that everything is expensive. You know that it is crowded. You really have no idea how bad it really is until you are in the middle of that mess. It would take coercion and the ability to carry a cattle prod for me to even consider it again.Ticket prices for a day or two work out to about $100 a day. If you want to go for a longer time, it makes the daily costs considerably less per day.It is always crowded (so I am told) but this was nuts. I have nothing to compare it to except maybe the crowd views in New York during New Years Eve. Simply waking place to place was time consuming. Waiting between 45 minutes to 200 minutes for a ride?!? Really??? Many of the rides broke down during the day. You would think they could maintain these things a little better. Considering the cost of everything they should be able to plate it in gold. The grounds were not as well maintained as other Disney parks around the world.There are a few good things about Disneyland. If you like the characters, they are always out to sign autographs and take pictures. They know how to make some pretty interesting rides: 3D, 4D with smells and other effects. They go all out for the holidays and even change some of their rides based on the holiday season. Haunted mansion was fitted with Jack Skellington things for Christmas and Its a Small World was also Christmas themed.The bottom line is that my visit sucked, but their rides and attractions are interesting hence the raiting of 2.

The reason is that Disneyland management does not regulate the number of visitors in the park. During our visit the park was so over crowded that the atmosphere was frightening. We entered around 11AM and by 1 the major rides had wait times exceeding 100 minutes. The problem isn't that Disneyland is poorly managed: it is the opposite. We encountered employees knocking themselves out to be helpful, the major rides were all working and the food was good. Of course, when we ordered a meal in one of the park's sit down restaurants we couldn't find a table. We actually put our tray on top of a trash can and ate on a bench in the sun. The women's restrooms had 10 15 minute lines and just getting from one ride to another was a frightening experience. There were so many pinched and unhappy faces in the crowd and many sobbing children. Our kids were actually ready to leave early: they were so disappointed. In the end we paid over $350 (plus parking and food) to ride two theme rides and the Tom Sawyer canoes. All of this could have been prevented by the Disney corporation thinking hard about park over crowding. Reading across the internet after coming home, there are websites and apps that provide info about crowds: the Disney corporation should tell you about wait times for rides and or projected attendance before you fork over your hard earned money.

That was entry tickets only. We chose the Disneyland park for the first day. We arrived around 8am and rode the Indiana Jones ride first. As we were exiting the ride, it broke down, so we couldn't ride it again. The Pirates of the Caribbean was also not working, and the haunted house wasn't working. We eventually were able to ride Pirates and the haunted house, but when we came back on our Fast Pass to ride Indiana Jones, it again wasn't working, so we didn't get to ride it. We also really wanted to see the Abe Lincoln exhibit because our boys love history. We tried to get in, but there was a private party, so we weren't allowed in. We couldn't go to the Lincoln exhibit on our second day at the park, because the second day ticket was good only at California Adventure. I didn't buy the more expensive tickets that would have allowed us to go to both parks each day because I knew we didn't have the energy to do both parks in one day. I didn't realize so many attractions would not be working or closed like the Lincoln exhibit. It's also crazy that we'd have to pay more for the two day two park ticket because of Disney's problems! The second day we went to California Adventure. We got there right when the park opened so we could get a fast pass for the new Cars ride. We got the fast pass, but . . . . the ride was broken down.

933,185364672,1,2013-10,New Zealand,"If it was possible to rate them a zero I would have. While I realise that Disneyland and Disney   s California Adventure are two separate parks they much of what I have to say applies to both parks. There is not enough information out their about either park for first time visitors. They cram to many people into to smaller space and charge way to much for it. It seems that the only way that Disneyland is value for money is if you live in California, pay monthly for an annual pass and spend most of your free time there. For staff that are responsible for moving a lot of people all the time, their crowd control is terrible. It seems to me that they have given responsibility to people who are to young and inexperienced, resulting in people who are on a power trip telling people what to do and where to go that is not conducive to getting anyone anywhere in a timely and efficient manner. The scheduling of things within the parks also seems to be an issue. For instance there is no way you can see both Fantasmic! and Fireworks at the Disneyland Resort, and have good views for both, due to the times they are scheduled for. Yes I accept you can see the fireworks from just about anywhere near the parks, if you want to see the Fantasmic! by the water then see the fireworks in front of the castle it is pretty much impossible. And forget trying to catch something in the other park. And for those of you saying go to parks on different days or get multiple day passes, what about those who can not afford the extra days or who do not have the time to spend in Anaheim as it is stop over on their trip somewhere else. Two big issues Firstly, lazy people on motor scooters that they hired at the park. I am by no means tiny. My BMI would put me into obese at the very least and I was repulsed by the number of lazy people driving round on these. Who seemed to be spry and agile to get into the lines and onto the rides but could not walk between them. I was in the park from 9:00 am until midnight I was by the end of it, I could have kept standing if I had to. The longest time I stopped and rested was the half an hour I spent sitting on the sidewalk along with thousands of others watching the parade at Disneyland. If you can   t walk the whole time don   t go. I have no problem with those who brought their own scooter because they needed it, but scooters should not be an option for laziness. Secondly, parents with children far to big and old in a stroller. Once a child is a certain age it should work (baring any medical conditions that require assistance). One women had an eight year old in a stroller. That is far too old!! And again these strollers are hired at the park. Fair enough have stroller hire for those who have travelled some distance to get their and weren   t able to bring the stroller for their little one but should they really be readily available to all and sundry who can squeeze their 8, 9 or 10 year old into one. Then they have massive areas filled up with stroller parking. One of which was prime viewing location for Fantasmic!The only thing I absolutely wanted to get at Disneyland was a picture with Mickey. I found a Mickey out and about, got in the line and then was told the line was closed come back later as Mickey has other things to do. Would that have been their response if I was child!Fast Pass, line time estimates, the phone app and line cutting.All very very annoying and all mean we line up for even longer. The day I was there the glamour rides all had three hour wait times and many had no fast pass. The estimated line times were not even close to being correct. For example on the board in California adventure it said 30 minutes, at the ride it said 45 minutes, the wait was over an hour. The phone app may be useful for those who live in California (shocking) and are therefore not paying roaming charges and who can check the waits before even leaving home. There was no way I could have used this app I would have spent a fortune on data charges to find out I had to line up forever. And then there are the people who put one person in the line, who texts everyone else when they get close to the front, who then push their way through the line, essentially cutting in. And you get people who wait for the shows hours before the start again saving space for lots of other people. Shame if there are only two of you and you only have limited time in the parks so one person can   t sit in a prime viewing spot all day saving space. High points (I did manage to have a couple):I did have one lucky break at Disneyland and it was purely by accident. I happened to be walking passed the entrance to Splash mountain just as they were reopening it. The possibly only helpful staff member we struck all day said to go now as know one was in the line. Walk straight onto the ride, which was fun and got soaked. Don   t think I would have been quiet so impressed if I had to wait three hours to ride though.I would say to anyone who does go, don   t rule out the non glamour rides. I loved the mad hatters tea cups and could have rode them all day.

I have no idea what happened to their maintenance, but it was really rather stunning. The people working the Indiana Jones ride told me it had been up and down for days. Often rides broke down after we had waited in line for 20 30 minutes, but before we could get on them. Try explaining that to your child, especially one like mine, who is autistic.But, hey, you can always go on Pirates of the Caribbean or It's a Small World ten times!Other thing   don't even think about going to the park on weekends.

The day started fine with the Tiki House and Jungle River cruise and crowd level was typical for Oct mid week and a great weather day. From here it was all a very frustrating and disappointing experience. I should add that I have visited this attraction twice before and have done the FAR SUPERIOR Disney World Florida theme parks multiple times. The sign on entry showed that Its a Small World and Thunder Mountain rides were down....but several more were also discovered to be unavailable for various reasons throughout the day including :Indian Jones, Disney Railroad,Splash Mountain,Casey Jones Railroad,Monorail  Some of these attractions suggested we check back later for availabilty which we did several times in spite of being dog tired from retracing our path. They continued to be unavailable each time.I voiced my concerns to consumer relations management ( Cavan ) at the site at 5:45 PM and was even more disappointed and frustrated at their response.  This was a $200 plus day including entry fee, parking and food and yet 7 attractions were unavailable and I expected some compensation for such a reduced attraction availability. In spite of us explaining we had only that 1 day in the area and that we had already been in the park for 8.5 hours , the Customer Service manager suggested he could grant Fast Pass to 2 of the closed attractions which according to signage in the park were still closed and he wasn't even aware of the status. He then offered 2 passes to Adventureland for another day even though he was told we were there from Canada for that day only. There were other comments about protecting the safety of attendees and I suggested that was an incredibly high number of issues that proper preventive maintenance should minimize or eliminate. They have from 9pm to 9 am to perform this. The grounds staff are generally polite however the attendant at the Monorail waited for park goers to climb the ramp to tell them   you people came at the wrong time , the ride is now off service for 25 minutes   in a smug and uncaring tone as opposed to going to the bottom of the ramp to advise people and prevent yet another long walk and wait !I think a discount to our entry fee, a park gift card for shops or dining could have been offered if they were truly a customer focussed business but instead we were left very disappointed, frustrated and would never recommend this facility. Another issue that was obvious was location of washrooms are a well kept secret due to absence of signage and only info was on the site map that is confusing and poorly scaled.In total we believe that the self proclaimed Happiest Place on Earth is their opinion and that they are complacent about true service level.We DO NOT RECOMMEND this park in spite of the Disney brand power.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

The first day, we spent most of our time at California Adventure, which had 4 decent  big kid  rides (Cars, Tower of Terror, Grizzly River, and California Screamin'). The second day we planned to spend at Disneyland. We knew Big Thunder Mtn Railroad was closed all summer for repairs, which were kindly noted on their website and app. However, we showed up at the Matterhorn that morning to find out it was down for the week for scheduled maintenance, yet no mention on the website app. It was, however, open the day before, which just annoyed us that we weren't informed or else we would've gone the day before. Then we went to Space Mtn, which broke down while we were in line. We were given a  front of the line  pass for any other ride, which was a formal printed ticket that said  any ride but Matterhorn , which just confirmed they had planned to shut Matterhorn down that week but didn't give ticketholders a courtesy notice. While waiting for the special ticket, another woman was telling us they had gone to Pirates and Indiana Jones first thing that morning and both those rides were broken down, too. Later that day, we got to experience that first hand, as Indy Jones broke down while we were waiting in line, but we were not offered a front of the line pass as a result. Luckily Splash Mtn was open, and Space Mtn was fixed later that day, but all in all, Disneyland was a total bust. They do not have enough  big kid  rides to have 2 of the 5 down for maintenance at the same time. As well, this is the last week of August, of summer, of tons of tourists traveling to LA for vacation before school starts   why don't you schedule maintenance the next week, when everyone's back at school and summer is over? Oh yeah, and we stayed to watch World of Color one night, and that broke down, too, about 5 minutes into the show. They got it going again after about 10 minutes, but by then we were over it and wanted to just go back to the hotel.We were very disappointed and had a hard time finding enough rides to entertain our family for 3 days.

When you arrive you have to get in a line before the ticket line and have your bags checked. I have no issue with that but there should be line for people that have no bags to have checked. We waited for 25 minutes for cast members to check bags and fanny packs and strollers. I got lucky and got in the line with a cast member that really takes there job SUPER serious. She looked in every zipper and was so slow people began talking crap in the line. Who wants to stand in line that isn't followed with a ride. My husband is Special Forces Officer and he said this is pure nuts that we have to go through this kind of a search for Disneyland. Oh it doesn't end there! When we finally got done than you go stand in line for the entrance into Disneyland and they take your picture of each person in your party. I asked why are we having our picture taken and the cast member said if you lose your ticket we know it belongs to you and you can get back in. My husband who is an Officer said yeah right they take the picture so if anything goes down in the park they have a face! So we spend the day at the park and at night my husband decides to go back to hotel for an hour. On way out they stamped his hand and away he went. When he came back they said couldn't come back in didn't have his ticket. His hand was stamped and he said well in the morning you guys said if I lost my ticket you had a face to go with it so check that and let me in and why did you stamp my hand then on way out just an hour ago? Long story short he never got back in and my phone was on silent due to parade or I would have gone up to the gate and gave them his ticket. Instead he went back to hotel and called Disneyland to speak with someone in charge that said leave a complaint and we will get back to you. No one ever did! We live in AMERICA not a Third world Country and if his hand was stamped and if our pictures were taken in case of lost ticket why was he on the outside not being let back in.

962,171922254,2,2013-8,United States,"I was disappointed during my recent visit to Disneyland. This is all Disney's fault. After all, they are the ones who set my expectations so high in the first place. Disneyworld is amazing. Disneyland has decent rides, and absolutely terrible customer service.First, the parks. If you have been to Disneyworld, then Disneyland will feel like a letdown in comparison. It is in the middle of a city, so you don't get the same experience of being transported to another world as you do with Disneyworld. Everything is smaller, especially the castle. It also feels much more crowded than Disneyworld. California Adventure is neat and has some things you cannot find at Disneyworld.The staff at Disneyland is not nearly as courteous or polite as the staff at Disneyworld. There were two particularly glaring examples of this. I was travelling with my disabled daughter and there were several rides at Disneyland where no attempt was made to provide a reasonable accomodation per ADA guidelines. In all cases, there was nothing about the ride itself or the line structure, etc. that prevented Disney from making an accomodation in our case. They simply chose not to do so. This is not the case at Disneyworld. Disneyland also does not advertise the fact that they fail to comply with ADA requirements, so guests with disabilities who are used to having reasonable accomodations at other parks get no warning that a good percentage of the rides will be unavailable to them until after they have paid their non refundable money for tickets.The ride operators were not polite about the failure to provide accomodations. One man literally screamed at a woman in line in front of me and told her that she should go somewhere else if she didn't like how they had set things up. She and her daughter walked away in tears as a result. Other operators were repeatedly confused and provided conflicting information on where to go when using a guest assistance pass, etc.We stayed to watch the fireworks one night. There were repeated warnings that the park lights would be turned off and we should not move during the fireworks show, so my family and I picked out a spot along the railing to the side of a walkway. Five minutes after the show started, a Disney employee started shining her flashlight in my face and loudly told us that we needed to go somewhere else because we were blocking the walkway. Keep in mind that the walkway was about 20 30 feet wide at this point, and we were taking up at most 2 feet of this as we stood touching the side railing. I politely told the employee that I did not feel safe trying to move with my 3 small children in the darkness. She responded by threatening to call security and have me kicked out of the park! During this exchange, my oldest daughter got confused and started to follow the Disney employees instructions by walking off into the dark night into a crowd of people. It took us 5 10 minutes to find her and the Disney employee refused to let me use her flashlight or provide any other help in locating the child that she had caused to get lost.These experiences unfortunately marred what should have been a very enjoyable experience at Disneyland.",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

Specifically, the majority of the employees, mostly on the California Adventure side, were terrible. They lacked any semblance of manners and were condescending when asked for information, especially if you had any sort of a disability. However, there were a few employees who seemed to enjoy their jobs and went beyond what a normal person would expect to assist you or just to ask how things were going. On one particular incident, my daughter was busy vomiting up, in public, her clam chowder bread bowl she had just finished eating from the bakery in California Adventure Land. The employees and the  Lead  cook of the bakery were totally uncaring and condescending when out of nowhere one of the busboys stopped and assisted us. He seemed genuinely concerned about her welfare, kept repeatedly asking if we wanted him to get someone other then the employees of the eatery to help us, asked if he could get her some water, medical assistance, etc ... go figure, the lowest of the lowest paid is going out of his way to accomplish the goals and vision of Walt Disney, where the supervisors and the managers were failing miserably.On the bright side, most of the rides were in working order and they were clean. The employees working on the rides on the Disney side were very helpful and cheerful, however on the California Adventure side it was totally opposite. 90% of the ride operators were either rude or uncaring and virtually all were unfriendly. However, again, there were a few employees who stood out with their friendliness, mostly because they took the time to approach us and ask us if we needed help or just to start a conversation with us.Overall, I would would recommend the Disney side to others.

984,163622206,2,2013-6,United States,"I find this review very hard to write. I am 50 years old and have, my entire life, visited Disneyland a minimum of twice a year. Growing up we weren't very wealthy but my father loved this place and what Walt Disney stood for SO MUCH that he brought us to the park all the time. It has been such a magical place for me and ultimately for my children (now aged 21   26). We have been pass holders before passes were so affordable and easy to acquire. I know that  once upon a time  Disneyland didn't have competition, but now people have so many attractions to choose from that Disneyland may no longer be first choice.In the past year, I have noticed a great change in Disneyland. The first thing is how busy it is on almost any day of the year. Due to the annual passes, many can come everyday if they choose to. I have been at the park during a school week and the park is filled with Mom's and their toddlers. They use the park as a place to entertain their kids and then around 3:30 all heck breaks lose when parents of tweens and teenagers drop their kids off at the main entrance and drive off to have a peaceful evening. Translation for the adult Disneyland enthusiast is a crowded park with long lines 90% of the time. It has become impossible to ride a substantial amount of rides in one day. We have averaged 5 6 rides PERIOD.I feel that this enslaught of unattended teenagers has caused the  cast members  of Disneyland to also lose their cool. With each subsequent visit I find more and more not friendly cast members (Disneyland employees are referred to as Cast Members, not employees). Our last visit was my breaking point, when we were accosted by a front gate cast member and then her Lead Cast Member (supervisor) was just as nasty as her. Very unprofessional behavior for any park, absolutely unheard of from Disneyland, or is it? When a supervisor supports the nasty behavior from their employee I then know that this issue goes straight to the top. There is a managing employee that has told them whether directly or indirectly that this behavior is allowable. VERY unacceptable for my family and I. At this point my husband was demanding I have his annual pass cancelled and my 21year old son wanted to do the same with his own pass. This is how bad the situation was.The last major complaint I have is their food quality and service. I used to be excited that I would get to graze all day in the park. This is no longer the case. The food is horrific, badly made, badly kept fresh and absolutely horrible temperatures. I find that the food in not only tasteless but I am sure can be dangerous to our health. I know you are asking where are the health inspectors, think about this. A health inspector will have to come in through a secured entrance where they will announce their intent. A quick radio call to lead supervisors gets the park on alert immediately and things are put in place prior to the inspector having a chance to come to one of the food vendors. This last trip we ate at the Taste Pilot's Grill, which is located in the California Adventure Park near the Soaring over California ride. You can read my review of that restaurant next. : ) Let's keep it short the food was horrendous. Cold cheaply made and they charged an arm and a leg. The service was nothing to get excited about either. No wonder we found seats in the patio area, people already knew to avoid this place.So what to do? Disney will eventually realize that the peoplel who actually spend money at Disneyland are no longer visiting, or when we do visit we keep it short and sweet. We do our shopping and eating away from the park. I know that my family of 10 (whose passes I pay for) will not be rushing to visit anytime soon. I am really hoping that Disneyland comes to it's senses and realizes just because the park is busting at the seams everyday may not be the wisest business decision when it comes to money. And that if they do not pick up their employee training and create happy cast members again, that the customers coming to the park will also start behaving in an angry nasty manner. I know we left for the first time ever before closing because of our experience with the nasty gate agent. We left because we could no longer be nice, the agent set our tone for us.I really hope changes are affected, I miss the enchancted kingdom as it once was.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

So...in a nutshell, not the best experience. Went with some older family members this time and were completely disappointed and frustrated. No character's running about like before. The parades had less floats than before. The addition of the watershow only turned into a huge disappointment. Thankfully when we were there last time with young family members, we got to see Mickey, Minnie, Goofy(even though the niece was terrified of him), Max, princesses...the parade was totally worth the wait then. I'm just glad that this time it was only adults who were able to live with the disappointments.A word of advice to those families out there who are planning a trip to LA to do the Disney thing. Come in February or November. Take your kids out of school and avoid the peak season. Cheaper to fly to LA, cheaper for hotels, no ridiculous lines queues crowds. It may be worth the outrageous prices if there aren't those things to worry about.After all was said and done, we were joking that for an extra 10$ a night we could have got a parkside room and watched the fireworks nightly from the room and saved on the park fee, especially since the best view of the new watershow was looping on the hotel's Disney channel endlessly day in day out.

1002,156525117,2,2013-3,United States,"Like SeaWorld in San Diego, Disneyland and California Adventure have a  no food  policy. That is to say, you're not allowed to bring in any food or drinks. This is ostensibly  because there aren't enough picnic tables to accommodate people who bring food, and people who buy food inside the park . I happen to know a former SeaWold executive who told me what everyone knows to be the real reason: they don't allow you to bring in food, because they want you to buy theirs. To understand this, you need to know that at these places, it's less to do with  magic  and all about the trickery of making vast amounts of cash. At SeaWorld their objective is to extract $100 a day per adult, in parking, food, drinks and merchandise ($60 per child)   this is after paying an already exorbitant entrance fee. Markup on what they sell across the board isn't the typical retail 50%, but (brace yourself) upwards of 1,600%. I couldn't believe it either, but when you consider that a hot dog costs less than 25 cents to produce, and the fact that they sell them for $8, then this figure is accurate. The crowding is all part of their marketing plan too. Although they could limit numbers into the park to avoid the horrendous waits, they don't   and there's a reason for this: if you're swiftly able to go from amusement to amusement, you're less likely to stop and buy anything.    For their part, it's smart marketing. Caveat emptor.    So how do you save money at Disneyland and California Adventure? Here's how: don't eat there! Bring in as much food and drink you think you'll require and if they hassle you at the gate when they search your bag, tell them you require a special diet because you have  type 2 diabetes . The dimwit checking your bag probably won't even know what diabetes is; all you need to tell him her is that in the U.S., diabetes is considered a disability and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973   states that no person entering a  public accommodation  can be subjected to any form of discrimination. Legally, public amusement parks are defined as a public accommodation.     But I'm not diabetic?    So what? They're using deceit to fleece you, why can't you do the same to save yourself a lot of money? Two meals at SeaWorld for a family of four will set you back more than $100. The equivalent from any supermarket will cost you no more than $30.   By the way, regarding your having diabetes; you have to prove nothing. Just like they can't ask a wheelchair bound person why they require a wheelchair, they have no right to ask you to prove that you have diabetes. If you want a coup de grace, get yourself an inexpensive arthritis bracelet.",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

Temp over 100 degress with no where to sit. 5 minutes before show they let in 100s of people in our special area. We had a good place to watch until 100s got in front of us.

However, when you witness the lineups at 9.30 in the morning on a weekday in January, then you become aware of the potency of the Disney marketing machine. The Disney scenes are very impressive, and the Cars ride has a fantastic backdrop, but I am not sure any of the rides are worth spending so much time waiting in line for. if you don't line up for the fastpass as soon as you get in, then you might well miss the ride unless you can handle long line ups of 2 hours  for a 4 minute ride. One can only imagine how bad it is in summer or on weekends, when almost all the rides will be affected.In reality, it is fine for small kids, but once over 10 years old, the attractions are limited and there are many parks that have more and are significantly cheaper. The attraction of Disney is incredible as you can see large crowds on all days, and horrendous numbers on weekends. Food is expensive, as are drinks and snacks. With two parks, Disney has managed to increase revenues substantially, even charging you an extra $30 if you want to go from one to the other, something that appeals as you can easily get through one in a few hours (unless you spend most of that time in line ups). The older Disneyland park is looking tired, its attractions are dated, especially when compared to smaller parks, but other larger parks are now substantially more interesting with far better rides.It might be the happiest place on earth for Disney shareholders, but lots of people are paying a lot of money for participating in one of the great marketing exercises of all time.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

This was after a 4 month trip to many world destinations. Disneyland was the biggest let down of our entire trip. I feel Disneyland has got greedy, charging exhorbitant prices for food and merchandise. OK, we didn't have to buy anything   and we avoided it as much as we could. Actually bought Disney products at Target store and they were really cheap. But the biggest negative aspect of the visit was the endless queues and the long waits to get into the park in the morning. We went after the holiday season in LA when it was supposed to be quiet and still the wait time for all rides was at least 30 mins. Cars Land was 180 mins. The ride is amazing tho when you get on. Without the Fast Pass system we would have been hooped. Managed to do about 4 5 key rides a day using this. So if you go, be sure to master it early on. We bought a 3 day pass to get the Magic Morning early entry. That day it took 55 mins for the staff to process the queue so we could just get in the gate.

We did the Alcatraz tour in San Fran and this in on a limited ticket basis and you have to book weeks in advance. But it was fabulous and a great experience.

I would like to share my experience with you and hope there will be an improvement on Disneyland's procedure for multi day passes.I had a 5 day Park Hopper ticket and was re entering Disneyland park, I presented my ticket and my photo ID to the lady named Isabella (if I remember correctly), she was looking at my ticket and questioning me why the ink was not dark, I said I did not do anything to make the ink fade, in fact, I used the pen provided by Disneyland to write down my name on the ticket on the first day of my visit, after that, I just kept using my ticket, the ink was fading by itself, nothing I could do about it. She insisted on saying that the pen was the permanent mark, the ink should not fade at all. I said if the ink was fading, then the pen was really not a permanent mark. She asked me to step aside saying someone would check my ticket, I had no choice but to follow the order, however, I never expected I would wait for more than 10 ~ 15 minutes (it felt like forever) to get my ticket back. I was in a hurry to join the crowd for the countdown and fireworks, but the Disneyland lady and her lead seemed not caring about it at all.They took their time and did not even bother to care my concerns. I asked the lady when I could get my ticket back, and why it took so long to check the ticket, she simply answered  my lead had your ticket ...  with very arrogant, cold, and careless atitude, and no explanation on why it took so long. I said anxiously that I needed to catch the fireworks, but she DID NOT CARE AT ALL!!!All my family members got in with their tickets, but they had to wait for me, they really did not understand what was wrong with my ticket, my name was still there, just the ink was light, there was no sign on misusing of the ticket.Finally after a long time, her lead Robert came back and gave the ticket back to me, Isabella used a pen to put the new ink on my name. I asked Robert why it took so long to check my ticket, again he simply said  oh, I needed to validate your ticket ... . Okay, you could validate my ticket, but with the world class Disneyland park, it took more than 10 ~ 15 minutes to validate a ticket? and I was blocked at the door for almost 20 minutes in total from the beginning to the end. There were no apologies from Disneyland staff at all! I was so frustrated and upset.My whole family went to the City Hall and spoke to the management. We brought up our concerns seriously; while we were in the City Hall, we missed the countdown plus the beginning of the fireworks, we rushed to the outside and watched the fireworks from a not so good view point, my Dad missed the whole fireworks since he continued discussing our concerns with the manager.The incident totally ruined our New Year's Eve celebration at Disneyland which was the most important part of our visit, and I just do not understand why I should be punished while it was not my fault at all? If anything was wrong, it was the pen, the pen was provided by the Disneyland Park, I had nothing to do with it. Because of the poor  permanent mark , it wasted my and my family members' precious 20 minutes on New Year's Eve, plus the time to report our concerns.I visited Disneyland, LA, two times in 2011 with my 5 day and 6 day tickets, I enjoyed my visits and felt the Disneyland staff was so friendly and well trained. But the experience I had in 2012 destroyed my good impression on Disneyland completely. We already felt a lot of inconvenience of showing both the tickets and the ID's in 2012, and then on top of it, a lot of suspicions and distrust. I paid $300 for my ticket, and I did not think I should be treated like that way.I really feel a new solution should be come up to respond to this situation. I saw some other guests with the valid tickets were blocked at the entrance too; to me, that experience is the ultimate insult and humiliation. I always use valid tickets, and with the tickets I was never ever blocked at the door anywhere else except Disneyland. We were coming for the happiness, but not for the distrustfulness, the interesting thing was, after that lady rewrote my name on the ticket using the pen, a couple of days later, the ink faded again! I still have my ticket with the faded ink.Disneyland did not have a good procedure for the multi day tickets, the current procedure is not working!! the pen was not actually a permanent mark, therefore, Disneyland should take the consequence, but not me, not the guests!!!",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

For the Star Tours Fast Pass, at 1:00 a.m., we stood in line outside in 45 degree weather, for 40 minutes. Patio heaters would have been helpful.The lines for food were very long. After purchasing our food, we could not find seating inside, so had to try to find a table outside. It was cold that day, so by the time a table was available, our hot food was now cold. And, of course, the food was expensive! No patio heaters outdoors, either.The lines were just as long at the California Adventures Park. We've been to Disneyland quite a few times before, but this was the worst time we ever had there. This was not a happy time and my daughter and I have no desire to return.

When you get into the parking lot, the cashier asked us if we already had tickets, which we had already purchased online. He let us in after paying the $15 fee and handed us a green ticket that stated that Disneyland Park was busy so they were not letting in people anymore. I guess that is Disney's way of lifting off their liabilities. We had the 2 day, one park per day package and were visiting LA with a 6 year old. So it is not like we had the luxury of coming back another day where it was less busy.We were still able to get in despite the extreme business. It was packed, so packed that you could barely see the grounds. I felt unsafe to get around and was holding my daughter's hands the whole time. We tried to get by during the parade so we could do some ride. Impossible.Average wait time was 50 minutes for each ride. We only managed to do 2 rides in between the parade in the 4 1 2 hours we were there. Food is awful and extremely expensive. $35 for the 2 worst hamburgers we ever had and a mini pizza which was more dough than pizza and 3 drinks, that is extreme. We also had to line up for that 20 minutes. And line up for the washrooms.It was a big disappointment for us and anything but magical.

We tried to line up 30 minutes before the parade and we ended up somewhere we could only see the back of the floats :(The tickets were EXPENSIVE (A$1100 for 5 day park hoppers for our family of 2 adults and 2 children).

I paid $6 for a hot dog that was a micro bun and a small sausage. I've had better food, and more reasonably priced, in airports :( If you want to actually see World of Color, buy a meal that includes a fast pass to a reserved area. It's add on, add on, add on.

1037,148467521,1,2012-12,United States,"For Christmas I surprised my 12 year old nephew with a trip to Disneyland. We drove from Las Vegas on Dec 26, planned to go to the park on the 27th and leave on the 28th. When we arrived in Anaheim on the 27th (about 11:30am) the place was CHAOS. We got routed and re routed several times to find parking. After about 2 hours we finally were lead to a garage behind the convention center. We paid our $15 and entered the garage. Up and up we went ever looking for a space. We got to the top, did a complete circle only to find there were NO SPACES! It took over 45 minutes to get out of the garage as they were still letting people in. We finally were directed to a supplemental lot near the boom lifts. From there we walked back to the shuttle location only to be told (by a disney employee) that the wait was about 30 minutes or that we could take the 10 minute walk to Disneyland. We opted to walk. While frustrated, we were determined not to be angry so we made a pact to have a positive outlook and started our walking journey. What they said would take 10 minutes was really about 25 minutes and quite a far distance.When we arrived at the entrance it was more CHAOS. We chose a queue line and started to wait for tickets. We noticed that the line to our right was shorter so we moved. An employee at the side of the queue line told us  oh by the way, Disneyland is closed as it is at Max capacity. But you can go to CA Adventures . When I explained we werent really interested in the other park she turned away and ignored us   guess she figured she didnt need to speak with us any further. We left the line and spoke with another disney employee who told us that maybe at 5pm they would re open the park after the parade. We then overheard two other employees talking about the issues and uncertainty of the opening plus the fact that Friday would be even worse than today. i can not express how frustrated and angry I was but was trying to remain positive as i wanted the nephew to have a great day!I requested to speak with a Lead. When I explained our crappy day to him, he could have cared less. He gave me a long winded speech on safety and the fire marshall. His suggestion was for me to buy FULL PRICE tickets and wait til they opened the park at 5pm or so. No accomodation or suggestions on how he could make our experience better. WHAT THE H**L HAPPENED TO THE FAMED DISNEY GUEST SERVICE???? Disney used to be the standard for guest service that others wanted to emulate. NOT ANY MORE. Guess they had so many guests that they didnt need my money or my business. Their wish is granted.I asked my nephew what he wanted to do   his answer was to leave and never return. I agreed.Next day we went to Knotts Berry Farm and had a GREAT time. Things Disney should have done1. warned or informed guests of peak days on their website2. had the employees at the parking garage tell us that Disneyland was at capacity and only the secondary CA Adventures was open (Had we known this we would have left sooner and not been as unhappy)3. Taught their staff guest service4. Offered us some type of discount or accomodation to make up for the problems5. Anything other than a lecture on safety At this point I dont ever want to return to Disneyland. My disappointment with them and their lack of service is immense.

The whole fast pass idea is a flop. The radiator springs fast passes were gone before 11 am. I think it's time Disney made some changes. We would have gladly paid the extra $400 for a real fast pass like Six Flags offers. I will say that the Christmas decor was magnificent. Could not see the parades due to the crowds.

Time and time again I saw the workers look unhappy. The streets are small. We had someone with a wheel chair and it was almost impossible to get though. Disney does not have any lockers on the outside of one of the entrances. So we had to walk though to another gate, then walk out. Use a locker then wait inline again. I was not happy.

The lines for the 3 rides our kids most wanted to see Splash Mountain, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Space Mountain were 1 to 2 hours minimum (with 140 minutes posted for Splash Mountain when we left). Check out our photos to prove it. The wait for a cafeteria style lunch at non peak time was 45 minutes. There were not nearly enough bathrooms; we waited 20 minutes once. Even the wait to get into the parking lot was 45 minutes. The drinking fountains were the non chilled kind and many were stopped up. The only highlights were the Pirate's Lair, on an island reached by ferry so less crowded. it was described as a natural environment, meaning the same fun could be had for free at any state park playground. The Columbia ship ride and canoe adventure also were fun. The experience was so awful that we came up with a game called Pretend Silver Linings, so we could try to laugh at the fact that we'd paid $450 to get in.

For some unknown reason the toon town section of the park doesn't open until an hour after the rest of the park, and toon town is one of the areas that closes early for the fireworks. Several attractions were closed for maintenance.We barely saw any character actors. We had to stand in line for 30 to 40 minutes to see a character when they were available. We were ignored by one set of character actors we found wondering in the park. We waited in line on another character actor while she went on break with no one replacing the character for more than 20 minutes. We were assured every five minutes by rude staff member that the character would be right back. I think the staff member was trying to be entertaining, but he was rude and obnoxious. We eventually gave up waiting and left. Is there a rule that only one Mickey Mouse character actor can be present in the park at a time?We all expect the food to be expensive, but there are sit down restaurants in the park that are over $30.00 a plate.

Lines were so long and by the time we arrived, most of the Fast Passes were already gone for the day (many rides that used to have them no longer do). Plus the additional thing that has made going to the Magic Kingdom not so magic anymore is the overabundance of mobility carts.

If an able bodied guest arrives and is subjected to a 45 minute wait, why aren't the cart riders? It gets worse and worse every time I go.

But I took my family of four last week (6 28 & 6 29) and it was NOT  the happiest place on earth  by any stretch of the imagination, with numerous ride closures and interruptions. The first indication of things to come was a distorted speaker in the Indiana Jones car that kept cutting in and out, and made that bumpy ride seem unpleasantly jarring. Then it was a Haunted Mansion closure, a Matterhorn closure, a Space Mountain closure, then Splash Mountain too, if I recall. It was one disappointment after another! We finally got a chance to go in the Haunted Mansion, but there were still technical glitches on that ride that caused it to stop along the way. The next day, we arrived at CA Adventure early enough to get our Fast Pass for the new Cars ride. We returned twice during the day, and both times the ride was down! Then, at the end of our stay, Symphony Swings closed after the first light show, contrary to what we were told by the attendant on duty. An appropriate ending for a not so happy couple of days that cost us over $1000 at the parks alone. We ended up doing a lot more walking and waiting than riding, that's for sure. With ticket prices as high as they are, I can't afford to get stung like this again. My girls can return when they're older and able to drive themselves, but I've seen enough to not need to visit again.For anyone else who is dissatisfied with their Disneyland experience I can offer this advice, (given to me by their Guest Communications dept.):  If you encounter any inconveniences or disappointments, please feel free to inform a Cast Member that you would like to speak with a manager.

1097,128477044,1,2012-4,United States,"Disneyland used to be  the happiest place on Earth,  but after having been a resident in Southern California my entire life and owning an annual passport to Disneyland for several years, I have seen first hand the decline of this once wonderful place to visit. There has always been a distinct difference between Disneyland and other theme parks in the area such as Six Flags Magic Mountain and Knott's Berry Farm. Disneyland has always been, to me, family friendly, a nice crowd of people, clean, homey, etc. In recent years though, the park has become less than satisfactory. The park's popularity and obvious growth of the population over the past 20 years in So Cal has greatly affected the quality of this once wonderful vacation spot. Despite the cost of tickets and annual passes, which have increased immensely, the crowd does not seem to dissipate. The crowd has truly increased with the prices making a visit to Disneyland unbearable, especially on the weekend. Until the park manages the amount of people allowed into the park on a given day, I will not be renewing my Premium Annual passport (now approximately $500 annually) and neither will the rest of my family. I will be writing a letter to Disneyland to suggest that they manage the amount of people allowed into the park at a time. There should be a system in place, perhaps some type of reservation system that allows visitors to call in advance and book their trip. If someone decides to go to Disneyland last minute, they can still call in and book a trip if there are available spots. This system could also mimic the fast pass system currently in place in the theme park. Not only is a trip to Disneyland these days unpleasant, but for a park catering to parents and their children, a family park, the amount of people make the park extremely dangerous. I could only imagine if there were some type of natural disaster in the park, children, elderly and handicapped would all be trampled with the amount of people around. I will be using my pass up until it expires and will probably not be visiting until something changes with this once magical place. I wish everyone could have experienced it the way I did as a child.P.S. The food at Disneyland and in Downtown Disney is awful and definitely not worth the price.

Aside from our extreme level of frustration, my bigger concern is my sons' safety. Had there been any sort of problem my boys would have been in jeopardy. To give you an example of the crowd, I was at Disneyland on the 50th anniversary, arguably one of the most crowded days in the park's history, and this random Sunday was worse. I find it hard to believe that the park had not far exceeded maximum capacity, but I guess when I get on an elevator, and look at the elevator's maximum capacity of people it too seems ridiculous. Disneyland is no longer a fun and safe place for me to bring my kids. Between the drive, parking, getting through the crowds, its stressful and dangerous.

We were wrong. Luckily we were at the gates at 8:00am, and for about 2 hours, were able to enjoy the place. We hit a few big rides like Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean. They were nice I guess, but not great, something you'd wait 10 minutes to see, but not much more. Then by maybe 11am the place began to swell with people. And I mean SWELL, from comfortable walking around to jammed packed, stroller to stroller, bumping into people constantly because the aisles simply could not accommodate the ratio of people to walking space.We began thiinking  what the heck? How could this many people be paying the $300 we paid to get into this place, here on this day in March?  And my husband quickly figured it out. The park wasn't filled to the brim with people who had paid a fortune to travel to CA, book a hotel and rental car, and pay the huge entry fee. Nope. The majority of them just hopped in their car, grabbed the ANNUAL PASS, and headed over with all the kids. And just how little do these folks pay per visit? Well looks like most of them paid $80 and a pittance of a monthly fee ($9.92 or some such figure) for a whole YEAR. As many visits as they want. And what's to stop them with sharing these passes with their relatives and friends? By the looks of the crowd and Disneyland, it's pretty obvious that these annual passes are being both heavily used and maybe even abused.So as an out of towner I really resent the fact that I just paid 300 bucks for a couple of hours of enjoyment, coupled with about 6 more hours of misery, so that I could essentially subsidize the locals   who apparently have a different expectation of personal space, and can go to Disneyland for a whole YEAR for the same money I just paid for 1 lame day.Surely Walt Disney is turning over in his grave.

1118,125190313,2,2012-2,United States,"Let me start by saying that I don't really like crowds and I'm not into thrill rides, although I'll ride them if someone else wants to go. Our family (12, 10, 8 year old kids) just returned home last night after spending four days between the two parks.What I love about Disneyland is that the park is clean and the staff are professional and very helpful. The creativity and attention to detail on ALL the attractions is quite remarkable and enjoyable. All the rides (once you finally made it on) were enjoyable, but I also enjoyed the evening parade and Moments with Abe. The Matterhorn was closed for refurbishment.The biggest thing I'll remember though is the crowds. Many workers mentioned that it was a  spring break  volume of people attending the park. I'm not an impatient person, I just don't find anythere worth standing in line 30 45 minutes to  enjoy . There were long, long lines everywhere and it just wears you out. In fact, it was quite miserable. It was very stressful that each day and each attraction had to be carefully planned, because you can't just walk up and expect to get in without a long wait. Unless you picked up your FastPass first thing in the morning, it would be 5 hours   on the return time.Oh, but what about the  Magic early morning  pass to get in an hour early? Well, evidently 30,000 others had the same idea. the only part of the park they opened were Tommorowland & the area behind Sleeping Beauty Castle. There were no Fastpasses until the park opened for everyone. It was an absolute sham. Our family spent our  magic  morning waiting in line for 35 minutes to ride Peter Pan, because it was one of the shortest lines and something we hadn't done yet.Overall, I'm so disappointed. I'm sure if we went during an off week (thought we picked a safe week), it would have been more enjoyable. However, now that I've been there, there is nothing there that I find worth going back to see even if the trip was paid for. It's just not worth the time and hassle for me personally. If you take your family, be ABSOLUTELY sure that every school is in session the week that you go.

It's a sweaty, stomping, mosh pit. Standing in lineups is the name of the game these days. Figure out the cost per ride and it's just so not worth it anymore!

Disneyland is a 3 hour drive from our home here in California so we hve been to Disneyland many times since our son turned 4. Each time we come we spend 2 3 days so we have plenty of time to get everything that we like done. We have been here at many different times of the year. This is the 3rd time that we have been in August. That being said, here is my opinion of Disneyland this time.I think this was the most crowded that I have seen it, even though some of the employees said that is was slower then it had been. We got a lot done with a lot of rides and shows,but we did make sure we got there early and used fastpasses. Make sure that you get your fastpasses for Star Tours EARLY, they run out by about 12:00. We got ours at 8:30 a.m. and the return time was for late afternoon. We did like how they have re done this ride. Also, make sure you line up early at California Adventure (before the park opens) to get your fastpasses for World of Color. We did this and got the Blue section (which is supposed to be the best) for the 9:00 show. This show was good but I didn't think it was as spectacular as some people do. I didn't think it was worth fighting the crowds to watch again. ( I would rather watch the fireworks at Disneyland).I have to agree with other reveiwers that there were alot of rude people and line jumpers. You would hope that Disney would catch on and do something about this.(line jumping, too bad they couldn't do something about the rude people!) We did encounter more Disney employees this time that just didn't seem to enjoy their jobs. I seemed to notice this more at California Adventures for some reason. So the reason that it wasn't as magical to me this time was because of the rude people and employees, the crowds were so big it was hard to get around and I hate how you have to show up at least an hour early to save a good seat at a show only to have the rude people show up at the last minute and give you dirty looks because you have the good seats and then try to push in front of you or at least push their kids in front of you! I also noticed this happened more on this trip then when we have been there before. As far as food was concerned, our favorite place to eat was the new Boardwalk Pizza and Pasta at California Adventure. They had a great 5 cheese ravioli and some great salads, oh and try the pomagranate lemonade  yummy! We used to like Bengal Bar B Que at Disneyland but this time the servings were even smaller then before and for the price that you pay we just felt it wasn't worth it. (the only thing I would get again was the veggie skewer because it was quite large.)We chose to go in August because they have all of their shows and fireworks every night but I'm not sure that it was worth it this time.

I thought so). After returning at the appointed 8PM time, my family waited 70 minutes and the ride broke. They never got to ride it. Disney didn't offer (we didn't ask for but assumed they would) some type of  sorry for the inconvenience gift . We had to wait a minimum of 65 minutes for every ride with the execption of Soar'n which we got to very early in the day. Overall we paid a lot of money to stand and wait, and stand and wait, and stand and wait. We rode as many rides as possible and that would be 7 rides. For $105 each. Not a good value for the money. When we weren't waiting in line, we were trying to make our way through crowds of people. The park closes at midnight (at least it did the day we were there), and as I sat waiting for my family to wait the 70 minutes to NOT get to ride Space Mountain (I opt out of this ride), I watched at least a hundred hungry people get turned away from the only sit down restaurant in the Tomorrowland area which closed at 10. Why they would close so much earlier than the park was a mystery. I can say every employee we met was friendly and nice.

The Disney way is absent at this park.The first thing we noticed is that the park was dirty. It is rare to see a full trashcan or any paper on the ground at DW. Not so at DL. DL had overflowing trash cans all throughout the day. The bathrooms were appalling. I understand that they are used continuously throughout the day but these weer just nasty. A number of the waiting areas for the rides had dirt ground in the walls and trim as well as paint ripped off the walls. The place is just trashed.There is a lack of characters at the park. We weren't there to see them as we had no small children but it felt like any other theme park because there wasn't any Disney characters. The cast members were not friendly or helpful. The park lacks maps and signs so we had to ask directions a few times and no one was friendly or helpful. In addition, the cast members were readily visible eating lunch, ordering lunch and arriving to and from work. The lines to get on anything were ridiculous. It seems as if the park needs to cap admission at some point. Three hour waits? No thank you. The Fast Pass is a joke. You can only get one every two hours. We arrived shortly after 9 AM and the Fast Passes for the  good  rides were already in the early evening. Also, on the Grizzly River Run, we had to wait in line and then had to wait in line while on the ride three times. WTF???

1175,114355530,2,2011-6,United States,"My husband and I went to Disneyland and Adventure Park to celebrate his college graduation. we are from Indiana, so we flew out to California and visited other places as well, such as Universal Studios and Seaworld  both of which we had a great time. We saved Disneyland for last because we were both excited for it, but boy, were we disappointed! We went to Disneyland on a Monday and it was completely packed. As we entered the park, we saw that the Matterhorn was down for the season. We were disappointed, but we entered the park and headed for Space Mountain. After waiting in line about 20 minutes, the ride shut down and they didn't know how long it was going to take to fix. We decided to move on to the Indiana Jones ride. We walked over there, and found out that it was broken down as well. We had wasted an hour by this point and were becoming frustrated, so we decided to eat at Pizza Port over by Space Mountain. The prices were outrageous! We paid $4 for two breadsticks, and over $7 for one slice of pizza! But the most frustrating thing was that the food wasn't even good. When we go to other amusement parks, such as Kings Island, the food is expensive, but at least it's good. By midafternoon we found some rides that weren't broken down. For dinner we ate at The Golden Horseshoe, and we were once again disappointed by the price and the taste. It was $26 for two small meals and one drink. Wednesday we went to Adventure Park. We went straight over to the big roller coaster, California Screamin', but, it too was broken down. We rode a few other rides and we surprised how small the lines were there. For lunch, I was wanting a pretzel, so we found a pretzel place on the map and headed towards it. When we got over there, it was behind the construction wall, and there wasn't a way to get over to it. We decided to do pizza instead so we found it on the map, went over to it, and once again it was behind the wall. It should not have been on the map if you cannot get over to it. Frustrated and starving by this point, we walked over to the other side of the park to a cafe. I got a sandwich and my husband got a bowl of clam chowder and a cookie, and we split a drink. $28 was our total and again, the food wasn't good, nor was the service. We waited about 40 minutes in line while there was about 12 workers there, 8 of which we standing around not doing anything. They were moving very slow. My bread was hard and it was stale. Not to mention there was not place for us to sit. They had about four restaurants altogether beside each other, and not enough place for everyone to sit and eat. We had to stand there with our tray and wait for someone to get done eating. After we ate, we watched Aladdin, which was probably our favorite thing the whole day. We went to a few gift shops, and we had about $50 worth of souvenirs in our hands. We got behind a couple in line and waited while she checked them out. We waited there about 10 minutes before the cashier told us that there wasn't a separate line for her register and we would have to wait in another line. She was very rude. She let us stand there the whole time while we checked the other people out. We were angry, and left the souvenirs and the park at 4 p.m, way before closing time.  Between Disneyland and Adventure Park we were frustrated with the rides constantly breaking down, expensive but not tasty food, the slow and poor service while getting our food, and the rude cashier. I would not recommend Disneyland to anyone. We felt like both days were a waste of time and money, and we will never go back. It was nothing like I remembered from the last time I had been there. Every other place we went to in California (San Diego Zoo, Universal Studios, Seaworld) I would recommend, but not Disneyland or Adventure Park.

There is NO perk to buying the meal. yes it says you can start lining up 30 60 min's before the show, we lined up 35 minutes before and got the back.

The fries were cold and soggy, resembling wet noodles. I had serious thoughts about taking it back, but what do you say? Excuse me, can you take this hamburger back because it's looks totally disgusting? I picked the nasty lettuce off and reluctantly ate as much of the hamburger that I could stand before I left the rest on my paper covered basket. My seven year old boy got the kids hamburger meal.

The huge deluge of water everywhere in the Park, for days on end, also caused approximately fifty per cent of the rides to be closed at any given time, for the duration of our holiday. Not good, when you have paid several thousand dollars, for a family Disneyland vacation, during Christmas. This was extremely disappointing, to my two children, and myself. Disneyland gave guests no compensation for operating at approximately fifty per cent functionality. I find this business practice to be completely unethical. Also, when I asked various Disney employees, why they were closing numerous rides, they dismissed me, walking straight past me, without speaking. Very arrogant and rude.

This happened to us on the Indiana Jones ride as well, but thankfully we had just shuffled into line when that news was dropped on us.)We got a great deal with plane flight, hotel and rental car, but I kept thinking of the foreign suckers that shelled out probably twice what I did to enter the rat trap. Tokyo $1,600, France $800...Hopefully they got deals like we did, but can you imagine hauling 4 people halfway across the globe to basically wait in line at the  Happiest place on Earth?  (It's like political talking points If you float it out there, many will actually believe it without looking into it guilty.)On the second day we were considering leaving at noon to take the kids to the beach (my idea), but I was voted down. I would have loved to see the kids be able to run in the sand instead of stand in line ride on my worn out shoulders again. I have read another review of a guy that  enjoyed spending time in line with the family chit chatting.  (Hey Scandanavian Donald from Newport, I'll flip the bill for your whole family to return to Disney if you can send me a video of your family just  chit chatting  in line for 2:15 hrs.)I know there are ways to beat the crowds (fast passes you're only allowed one per family at a time and they sell out by around 10am), but I shouldn't have to work the system when I'm paying $80 for a ticket. Disney owes its customers to alleviate the crowds by limiting the number of people through the gate or putting all that revenue to work and create a thinktank to streamline the process.Bottom line Ask your friends about their experiences. We sprung it on the kids on Christmas morning so I didn't spread it around with fear that the cat would get out. On my return two co workers said,  You should have asked me, I would have told you it was going to suck.

I was so excited weeks before to My last trip, On November 22, 2010, It was such a let down. The park obviously has cut back on services. You never in the past would have seen garbage cans overflowing. We went to the lockers and the machines wouldn't take the money or print the receipt and we could not find an attendant. Though it was cold outside the locker room was so stuffy, no air flow. First thing in the morning the bathrooms already smelled like port a potties and the sinks only have cold water in the cold of November. Apparently Disney wont pay for warm water. The worst was Cinderellas castle. The sewer smell was so overwhelming that we couldn't stand to shop in the shop and left. Nasty horrible smell. There were kids climbing tall walls by space mountain that says law suit all over it when they fall over, again no attendants. Of course the non attentive parents could care less, I just hate to see kids hurt or Disney sued. We always get shirts and other souvenirs, yet just to try and buy something was a 45 minute wait, only two registers in the store we were in. For the big bucks spent to go to the happiest place on earth, it seems now Disney has fallen into the bottom line and no longer cares about customer service. I'm sad. And lastly, we spent lots of time on main street and I never saw one Disney character except in the parade. 45  years of magic for me erased. Very very sad. Hotel, gas, food, souvenirs, in a recession, not worth it anymore. it felt like a cattle drive. It really breaks my heart that one of the places that dreams are made of is no longer that. I do want to say something positive, The shuttle bus service is great! We never had to wait coming or going and the drivers are very nice. A Big Thumbs up for them!

1197,72680742,1,missing,United States,"First, this is the only review I have ever written  I have noticed that Disneyland has felt less and less personal the past few times we have gone (we are southern Cal. residents). It seems that what was once a well oiled machine, has become very robotic and cold (not to mention $$$$$). Number one: Beware of the guy at the nearby Marriott (an employee of Disney) who sells the tickets to Disneyland. We had three families all staying there to avoid morning traffic as we were to meet an entire kindergarten class the next morning. We all bought our tickets at different times, however when we met up for dinner, we had all been sold three day tickets, and we were all baffled at how masterful the guy was at talking us up before we knew it. Had it only happened to one of us, you could say it was just one of us being gullible, but all three of us? Number two: Part of the scam was that we (each) asked if it was reasonable to go to the California Adventure for the light show (since we had a night to fill). Without any mention of anything extra needed, we were sold these three day things so we could view the show. He told us the time of the show, but neglected to tell us that a fast pass is required (and those are gone by mid morning usually)  So, we all have our $$$ 3Day passes, and keep our 10 very young children up late by going to a very loud restaurant on Disney Way (all restaurants had long waits). Then, we go into the Disney Adventure to see the light show, and we just keep getting ushered down a street by  cast members  with flashlights...We think we are being ushered to the show, but after tremendous amounts of walking with now very tired children, we figure out (by asking one of the wavers on) that we can't see the show without a Fast Pass (we did not know what that was). Even though there was PLENTY of room behind a rope surrounding the edges of the street, we were not allowed to either go inside the rope to watch or even stop where we were standing. I don't know if you can imagine, but three Moms and ten tiny children at 9:30PM walking endlessly, and being told they cannot stand for a moment. One Mom stood for a minute with her child to get a glimpse, and security was called. When we promised not to stand, the followed us from behind a little, making sure we kept moving. Needless to say, we were all furious that were sold 3 Day passes only to miss the whole reason we bough them  A pure scam. Number three: Disney Customer Relations: After all this, I at least wanted my money back for the night we just walked and were not allowed to do anything in the Park. The customer service was the worst I have ever encountered. Instead of acting sympathetic, they were cynical and argumentative. The person I spoke with loved to talk, and would give long explanations for why they actually did nothing wrong. After two separate conversation, and then asking for a supervisor, I again found the same defensive and unhelpful, unaccommodating attitude. It was as though they had memorized scripts. It was a very big disappointment to us all.",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line

The lines at the attractions were generally 75 minutes or so, and even when we got fast passes first thing in the morning, we couldn't do the ride til 9:30 at night. Some of the rides, like space mountain, were completely out of fast passes. We waited in line for HOURS and then when we finally got on the ride, it was...nothing. A roller coaster in complete darkness. Long lines at the Matterhorn for a sad little roller coaster with really hard seats that trundled past a shopworn  abominable snowman  and some plastic  ice crystals . Totally out of date and crummy. At California Adventure, we thought we'd get to ride the big roller coaster, but it was shut down for the day, no refunds. Same with the big ferris wheel.

1205,45711257,1,missing,United States,"Friday night at 7 pm, unbelievably crowded in  Downtown Disney . I was a single person visiting. the moral of this story is don't go to this resort if you're single. I first went to a Cajun Restaurant, Ralph Brennans. I was told there was only room for at the bar, although I saw several vacant tables. The hostess didn't have to courtesy to look to see that the bar was already completely full.The House of Blues restaurant was completely closed for a special event. Every other restaurant had at least a 45 minute wait, up to 1.5 hours. At this point it was 8pm.. I was ravenous. I returned to the Napa Rose restaurant, inside the Resort. Again, empty tables all around, but I was told I would have to eat at the packed bar. There were two chairs and I would be smashed together with strangers, but I was starving. 15 minutes passes, a waiter didn't even make eye contact me. I was furious. I went to the hostess and asked if there was ROOM SERVICE at the resort, and they said yes. I lodged a stern complaint with the manager of the Restaurant. First, it was obvious I was being denied a table because I was a single, and the restaurants didn't want to lose out on more revenue. Second, the resort is HORRIBLY unprepared for this volume of guests for dinner. The manager was nice enough to comp my room service dinner, but heck whats the point of going to Disneyland to eat by yourself in your room?If you're going on a busy weekend, be prepared for a LONG wait for dinner, rude service people and huge crowds.

1206,37656064,2,missing,United States,"This is my third lifetime visit. This was definitely the worst trip. Compared to what this place could be and what it is, it gets a 2 circles out of five and probably deserves 1.As other reviews have stated, there seems to be a problem with ride breakdowns. Out of three and a half days, the Indiana Jones ride broke down twice, the Matterhorn twice, the dumbo ride once and we talked to others that commented about other rides breaking down. The fact is, if these rides are maintained properly these things are not going to happen this often, if at all. I sense there must be budget cutbacks to maintenance staff. This is absolutely unacceptable. If you do a search you will find that one individual lost his life in 2003 on the Big Thunder roller coaster due to Disney's admitted fault in not maintaining the equipment properly. Do a search you will find more instances.This is not why I down grade Disney so much though. I down grade them because they have marketed the      out of Mickey. In my opinion, there should be more attractions and rides than stores selling the same crap all over Disney. Every where you turn they want to nickel and dime you for hats, food, more hats, shirts, clothes, etc. The rides and entertainment are secondary here to them selling you products and food.The place is hot and shade can be scarce. They need to get off their butts and install misting fans, misting nozzles and more shade throughout the park. Universal studios, although a complete rip off, does a great job with this aspectThere was no magic for me this time and I doubt that I really want to come back.The crowds of people were over whelming much of the time and this included weekday entry. The strollers get in the way. They are every where. You get tired of people running into you, cutting you off, stopping in front of you, etc. There were so many rude people that just made a home in the walkway where ever they felt like it. The fastpass machines actually closed about 6 pm one day, 6 hours before park closing timeI did not find any of the food enjoyable. The funnel cake sucked. The beef at the Mexican place in Frontier land was horrendous. The 20 cent bottles of water that they charge $3 for was bunk. The ice cream was good, but that really isn't food.Disney is relying way too much on the mouse and many outdated rides. The one star wars ride is from the early 80's and was pretty lame.I was disappointed that they actually allowed smoking in the park. The designated smoking areas are right next to the regular areas with no barriers in between. Again, I suspect this is an attempt to squeeze as many pennies as possible from all demographics.The bathrooms could definitely use some work. Everyone I used smelled bad and could have used some air flow. They were not particularly dirty just smelly. No reason for that.The good things are that the park was kept pretty clean and the young kids have a good time in Toon Town and other kid rides.

I have never in all the years I have been going to Disney seen anything like this before. I think it is probably a combination of things that has caused this. One, there were way to many people under the age of 20 without adults to influence their behavior and two, I think Disneyland is vastly under staffed. I was given a photopass card upon check in at the Grand Californian but over a 5 day visit found no photograghers in the parks.

My neice Meagan was turning 21 during this trip and she wanted to do The Princess Dinner at Ariel's Grotto. We had reservations set and she decided to make it extra special, we should all dress up. We had our faces painted in the park and went back to our hotel to dress up for our reservation. We were stopped at security for almost three hours because, well they had several diferent reasons depending on which manager was talking to us. First we were told that we couldn't go on rides in our gowns. When we told them we weren't going on any rides, we had reservations at Ariel's Grotto. Then we were told that we couldn't wear formal wear in Disneyland California Adventureland. Then we were told that they only allow anyone under 10 years of age to dress up like princesses. Then we were told that there was a possible trademark infraction because we could be mistaken for their Princesses. When we reminded them that their Princesses did not have face paint and tattoos, they changed back to the no one over the age of 10 was allowed to dress up. When we reminded them that they had a shop in Disneyland that sold adult sizes of their Princess dresses. That is when we realized that Disneyland is basically a money grubbing organization that will take your money for the dresses but you will not be allowed to wear them in the same place that you bought it. This was evident when I had sent an e mail previously to inquire how the grand marshalls of the parade were chosen. I was hoping that during our 5 day visit, My 10 year old neice could possibly get to be in the parade as a way to lessen the pain of the first holidays without her father after the aforementioned suicide. I was basically accused of using the situation to get special treatment when they choose people at random. After I found out that you can get a  special  tour for $150 an hour, I finally realized that it is probably the people that spend the extra money get the  special  treatment. You would think that they make enough money charging $194 for a 5 day park hopper pass. When we reminded the management that everyone was supposed to be a child again at The Happiest Place on Earth, they finally said that they would escort us to our dinner, I am assuming so that they could keep an eye on us and make sure we didn't do other stuff while we were dressed up. That is when we had to tell them that our reservation was expired since we had to wait at security for almost 3 hours before they finally came up with this brilliant idea and that California Adventureland (where Ariel's Grotto is) was now closed. We were allowed to go to Downtown Disney to find a place to have dinner and I couldn't help but think that no one has never dressed up to go to the fancy restaurants in Downtown Disney or that we were the first people to try to dress up like princesses for the Princess Dinner? After this incident, we saw adults dressed as Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan and Pirates and we asked them if they had been stopped at security because they were a trademark infraction or because they were over the age of 10. The answer was no, they sailed through security. Either they don't enforce there rules for other characters as much as they do for their Princesses or we must have looked better then these other people did and we were just too hot for Disney.

On our first day (a Thursday) we stood in line ups that were reasonable in length, but on 4 occasions, as we got close to front of line, the varous rides broke and were then shut down for repairs.With this sort of failure rate, I can only think that a fair number of the rides should just be shut down and undergo heavy maintenance to bring them up to a standard where failure rates are lower.I would rather walk into a park and see a ride is shut down for a day week month (which did occur as well at Calif Adv.) than stand in line four times for half an hour each have it break as you are about 10 20 people away from getting on the ride. That is alot of wasted time, and frankly very frustrating when you've spent significant $ (almost $600 for family of 4 with two day pass) just to get into the park (ignoring airfares, hotels, etc. associated).Our second day was planned for Calif Adv., on Friday. The parks are supposed to be open later on weekends, however the Park shut down at 6 instead of 8 for a private Halloween function. Now, just so I understand this, we pay good $ to enjoy the park, which they shut down early to get more money from some other people for a private Halloween function. Fair...NOT!As one previous poster puts it, Disney is now all about getting the $ out of our wallets rather than Walt Disney's original vision.I would agree.In a comparison of Calif to Fla. I would say Fla. has got the better park.As I said earlier, the kids will have some good memories of the rides that did work, and will likely forget about the frustrating ride failures, the reduced time at the parks. However, I won't forget how I spent lots of $ to get punted out of one park early, or waiting in lines in hopes of a working ride when it's our turn.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

1217,18171600,2,missing,United States,"I love the idea of Disneyland; the idea that Walt himself came up with back in 1955. But, Walt is long gone and so is the concept of this being a great family destination. In my opinion, it's all about the money and to cram as many people as possible into that park every day.If the park remained as quiet as the first couple of hours, I might have a different opinion. The first couple hours after the park opens is pretty enjoyable with short lines and room to breathe. But, as early as 10:00, you can feel it getting cramped, by noon it is a zoo, and by 2:00, you can't move. The rest of the day just gets worse and worse. Keep this in mind, the park pretty much averages close to 50,000 attendees in a day and those 50,000 people are crammed into a circle with a half mile diameter. That's about the size of your average football stadium which maybe holds a little more than that. It truly gets packed in.The rides themselves are fairly mediocre based on today's theme park standards. All of the rides try to tell a story and a lot of these are done by animations or animotronics. These are ok, but with just a couple of exceptions, the rides are all slow moving and don't take up much space as Disney really doesn't have much space. In my opinion, there really is nothing in the park waiting an hour for which you have to do pretty much all day when the park is busy. To put it in perspective, would you take your kids out in the car and drive a half hour away (1 hr round trip) to spend $5 each and go on a 3 minute ride and then go home? This is exactly what you do at Disneyland.While the park does offer the fastpass in order to make your wait shorter, the system is a total joke. We used fastpasses for a number of rides, but only on one ride did it seem to make any difference at all (Big Thunder Mountain RR). Many of the other fastpass lines merge in with the standby line after maybe going past 30 people. In the early afternoon, the fastpass system is really not worth it. By 2:00, the fastpass return was 7:30 at night for the major rides. By 3:00, it was 10:00 at night, and by 5:00, there were no more fastpasses available for the better rides.I do think a couple of the rides were fun, especially space mountain and indiana jones. The fireworks show is good and so is Fantasmic. But, even for those, the crowds at the park make it pretty unpleasant trying to find a viewing spot. People were lining up for spots for the fireworks around 6:00 for a 9:30 show. I'm not sure when people started showing up for the Fantasmic show, but if you get there even a little late, you are going to be standing with an obstructed view. After the shows, you are literally herded like cattle out of the viewing area.I do believe that our seven year old enjoyed the park as well as Mom and Dad. But, it's really not a good value at all. If you can get there on a slower day, it could be really worth the money. But, on a busier day (we were there on Monday, July 21), it's really not a good value for your entertainment dollar.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like

It is a part of my childhood, my teen years (dates and grad night); part of my child's childhood, and a place I could not wait to bring my only granddaughter to. OK I'm done. I will never step foot in the place again. Broken rides: Pirates, Indiana Jones, Splash Mtn or Thunder Mt.   whatever   down off and on all week end.Monolithic Crowds: it was impossible to walk two steps without tripping over a stroller. Great, heaving , sticky, sweating, tattooed, pierced, and sunburned masses.Fast Pass: a complete joke   worthless worthless worthless   don't bother. They make it so complicated   you can't reserve fast pass tickets for more than one ride at a time. What the use is that? The return time for the Indiana Jones ride was 11:50 to 12:50 PM   and we were at the kiosk at 4:00 PM!!!! We're supposed to come back at nearly mid night? What a joke.Lines: horrific. hours and hours waiting in lines. Fortunately, we stayed at one of the hotels (that's a whole 'nother Oprah) and could get into the park at 7:00 am   the only way I was able to take my g daughter on the Nemo ride   and even then it was a 30 minute wait   with only hotel guests there! Could not get near the thing during regular hours. Fuggeddabougit.Food: breakfast from the place across from the Nemo ride   no problem. Fine. Grab a egg bacon cheese croissant and stuff chunks into the kids as you wait in the Nemo line. Calif Adventure   had mexican food that was virtually inedible   microwaved burrito that was like eating shoe leather. Food in the parks   very chancey. Eat anywhere else but here.Ambience: not crisp, well groomed and perfectly maintained as it used to be. Looks tired and run down. One never saw a leaf out of place or a square inch of chipped paint years ago.The Disney Princesses: worth their weight in gold. Sweetest, most adorable girls on the planet. Just darling. They embody the perfection and fantasy Walt intended. Just enchanting.The Throw Up Rides at Calif Adventure: forget D land unless you have 3 year olds and head straight for C A. The Calif Screamin roller coaster is a good thrill. You feel like you've been shot out of a cannon. Skip the Ferris Wheel   even a 6 year old knows boring when she sees it, and she could not get off this worthless contraption fast enough. Nice strolling, wide open spaces and good ambience, though. Conclusion: save your money and head for Orlando. Now that's a party waiting to happen. Lots going on other than Disneyworld, which is much better than the Calif original. Lots more real estate to spread out over   it's a whole different world built for one purpose and one purpose only   PAR TAY!!!When I got back to the hotel room every day, I stood under the hottest shower I could stand and scrubbed myself all over twice with a stiff loofa.

1221,13222179,2,missing,United States,"We recently returned from our family trip to Disneyland. While Disney does a good job of creating a fantasy vacation, they definitely know what it means to have a monopoly. We stayed in the Grand Californian and found it impossible to have even a simple snack without spending at least $10 per person. I was shocked when a small individual serving size orange juice bottle was over $4 !! A breakfast sandwich in nearby downtown Disney (most likely with every vendor owned by Disney) was $9. Yes, that's right $9!! What you would pay $2 for in the outside world was more than 4x's the price.Here is the problem. You get to the park, your family is having fun enjoying the rides and then someone mentions they are hungry. You have to feed them, no choice, and Disney knows it. Our small family of 3 averaged more than $100 daily just to have simple meals and drinks while in the park.Then someone wants a sweatshirt, or a toy, or a souvenier of some type. You can't say no! This is a once in a lifetime experience, so you sucumb and allow Disney to violate you again and again and again. All the while, you are trying to justify paying 4 to 5 x's what anything should in reality cost by telling yourself you are at the happiest place on earth and making memories.Heed this warning. If you go to Disneyland or Disney World or anything Disney. Pack a back pack with food each day before you go. Have everyone agree you won't eat more than 1 meal in the park while you are there. Have everyone agree you won't purchase more than one souvenier and that the price of that item will not exceed x $'s.While the Grand Californian is a beautiful hotel, it is there to rob you of your hard earned cash just like the rest of the Disney regime. If you have a spouse who wants to stay in this hotel, insist that it be for only a single night and then stay at a nearby non Disney hotel for a fraction of the cost.Frankly, I would have really enjoyed the 4 days we spent in the theme parks if I didn't have to work for the next 2 months just to pay for the experience.

1222,12206650,2,missing,United States,"First of all, Disneyland was wonderful. The people were great. That said, DO NOT USE EXPEDIA TO PURCHASE PARK TICKETS. I had invited my entire family to a reunion at Disneyland and purchased a package thru Disney Travel which included hotel and park tickets. This was a 3 day trip and a couple of family members could not make the 3 days we were there but at the last minute were able to come 1 day before us and were to join us for 2 days but leave early . I purchased online park tickets for them through Expedia, two 2 day park hoppers. I coud not find anyplace during the purchase to enter any name other than mine, but since I was purchasing two tickets, I thought that was the way it had to be: obviously Expedia does not think 1 person will be using both tickets, so the name must not matter. I printed the tickets and gave them to my nephew to use.He and his girlfriend arrived at Disneyland but when they got to the gate, the person at the booth said they had no record of the tickets and sent him to customer service, who also could not find a record of the tickets.. My nephew had them call me directly. They said were still unable to locate a record of the tickets, going from the booth to customer service and then waiting while they explained the situation and then called me took aver an hour, added to the time they had to stand in line. I told Disney to just charge my credit card for another set of tickets and that I would work it out with Expedia but the people at Disney said they would honor the tickets, but asked that I bring a copy of my purchase information when I came the next day. They also kindly gave my nephew a coupld of Fast Passes to make up for the inconvienience. The next day I stood in line with my newphew and took the paperwork to the booth, where they once again searched and told me there was absolutely no record of the ticket I purchased from Expedia on file, but that again, they would honor it since obviously I had purchased it: I had all of the paperwork with me. Once again they gave us a couple Fast Passes and appologies. They were great. Here's when the problem comes up, I contact Expedia when I get home: they say the entire probelm was that MY NAME WAS ON BOTH TICKETS SO ONLY I COULD USE BOTH TICKETS. And yes, that's what it says on the fine print in back. They insist that that was the only problem with the tickets and refused to even address the issue that no one at Disneyland could even locate a record of the tickets. Together the kids and I lost 4 hours of time standing in extra lines trying to get the problem resolved, I asked for a partial refund, Expedia offered me a discount on a future trip. NO THANKS.

We decided to surprise our kids with a trip to Disneyland and left Christmas morning. We stayed for 5 days and 4 of the 5 days were sold out. We averaged 4 rides a day. UGH. My kids begged to just go back to the hotel and swim. I couldnt blame them. Disney is magical and it is the best theme park anywhere. I will never be able to take that away HOWEVER, if you go, DO NOT go during this time of year. It was a waste of 656. for park hoppers. Every single day, fast passes were sold out by noon. We preferred to stay late as we seemed to get more bang for our buck between 10 and midnight so, it really stunk that we couldnt get fast passes later in the day when we arrived.The parades were fantastic as usual but we didnt get to see many characters, and I dont blame them for not wanting to come out to the rude mobs of parents pushing their kids in front of others to get their pictures taken with them.All in all, I would NOT recommend that people go to Disneyland during Christmas. It is simply not a good value.Wait until mid Jan or early February to go if you want to ride a lot of rides and not have your heals ran over by strollers. True, you do give up warm weather, but I would take no lines over hot sunshine anyday.Still love Disneyland, DO NOT LOVE DISNEYLAND DURING CHRISTMAS.

This year, my daughter is approaching her 7th birthday, so we decided to take her to Disneyland for a Christmas gift. Once the decision for the gift was made, we had to decide on the day. December 26th!!! We were told by many that the park would not be as crowded as a few days past Christmas. They were DEAD wrong!!!We arrived at the park @ 10am only an hour and a half past it's opening time. The main parking lot was already full and we were directed to overflow parking. This provided us with a half mile brisk morning walk before we could even get to the ticket booths and purchase tickets. After plopping down $500 to get the family in to the park, we were promptly greeted with a crowd size of such magnitude I couldn't believe it. I have never seen so many people in one place at one time. Many of the people that (cough, cough) inadvertenetly bumped in to us were SoCal locals. One nice lady attempted to run my mother in law down with her stoller and when asked to be more careful, politely responded with  F*** you!  And a Merry Chistmas to you too! The most polite people we found were the ones who didn't even live near the park. We met a nice Seattle family, who like us, we quite astonished at the attitudes of those around us.So, we spent a total of 6.5 hours in the park. The little ones were so tired of standing in lines that they got to ride on 3 rides each. The big kids (myself included, wink wink) were able to make it on to 5 rides. Is it worth what we spent? I say NO! In fact, my wife and I agree on one thing, if we never see Disneyland again, neither of us will shed one tiny tear.Maybe Disney ought to take some business advice from some much smaller businesses like Snow Summit and the likes.

There were lines :To the tramTo get ticketsTo get through the gate (where they look through your purse )For all ridesFor food or drinksWell they need to plant more trees. On a very hot day there was almost no shade and the little shade that was around was taken already. There were no resturants to go into to get a little AC. Most were out door and really crowded or those little stands with or with out an umbrella and a nice hot wait in a long line.It is also very expensive, water was almost 3 bucks and food was 4 10 bucks depending on which stand you are in. There were a few water fountains but no where to get a cup with ice. Not even if you paid. Tickets have no discounts. No triple A no internet no anything. They will not give you a break. They promote the 2 day tickets that cost about 120$ and not much less for kids 9 and under. For a single day My family paid 70  70   60 for 3 one day tickets. About 200$ first thing then 5 waters at 3 dollars each for 15$ and a toy for 15$ for my three year old. About 230$. Parking was 10$ cash only too so that makes it 240$ At least we brought our own stroller which runs about 8$ There are stands selling toys everywhere and the other ones are selling drinks. They won't allow you to bring any in yourself to save. So you buy the tickets get the stroller get the drinks for the family and maybe some food and a gift or picture for the low price of 240$. That is too much for a place that needs to plant trees for the population of people customers that could use some shade, makes it impossible to find your way out and to the parking lot, and searches you because they do not want to loose a profit by having someone bring in thier own food and drinks, and renew and replace a ton of the old machinery. We were stuck on the Pirates of the Carrabean for 20 minutes in one spot because a boat got stuck in the front. This is unsafe, and expensive in my opinion.They must be so rich earning about 200$ for every one that goes in every day.

There was no line or sign outside posting a wait time however he waited inside Mickey's house for over an hour in a dark narrow hall way filled with tired children and parents. There were no cast members around and the Exits were not clearly marked. He ended up moving some props to find an Exit and lead a small exodus to freedom. All the while I sat in Mickey's garage with 8 other abandoned spouses making desperate cell phone calls to our missing families. The streets were lined 3 deep with abandoned Disneyland rental strollers. The entire place smelled of boiled hot dogs. I loved the rest of Disneyland and feel very strongly that the  Imagineers  who created Toon Town should be shamed into becoming grounds clean up workers.,Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like
1234,4587477,2,missing,United States,"I spent four and a half days in Anaheim in late February, three of them at the Disneyland resort. My sister has already rated the Parks based on this late February 2006 trip but I thought I would add my thoughts to this.A great many reviewers found disappointment at Disneyland due to the large crowds, unpleasant individuals, rude Cast Members, etc. While some may wish to suggest we've all made this up, that isn't the case. No sour grapes here, friends, just the facts: Disneyland is, indeed, too crowded and it absolutely makes for an unpleasant time.Only silly clowns can paint smiles on their faces and pretend the ridiculously long lines are fun, or that being bumped, pushed, or mowed down by rude adults armed with monster sized strollers is part of the Disney magic.I've seen the Park more crowded than it was on our visits February 20 23    but it still wasn't great. There are certain traditions I could do without, such as the Main Street crush prior to park opening, of which I have included pictures. That isn't part of the Disney magic, is it?You definitely have to have a strategy mapped out before entering the Parks, and you cannot deviate from it or your day is a loss. Even then, your plans may not hold if a ride is shut down, etc.But maybe that's the problem. Maybe you shouldn't have to have a strategy to enjoy Disneyland. I don't know what the answer to the problem is for the Disney folks    I'm not sure they are too worried about it as long as people parade through the gates willing to put up with it. It's not :sour grapes  to be displeased with it    if anything, it's foolish to pretend it's wonderful when it's not. The cost of tickets, hotels, etc. is too great these days not to get the most from your money and enjoy a pleasant, high quality experience.For what it's worth, I was at the park late August 2005 for three days and it wasn't nearly as crowded as it was in late February. How do you explain that one?",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like
1235,4565138,2,missing,United States,"We visited Disneyland on February 24 & 25 as my son had a vacation and we thought the parks wouldn't be too crowded. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The last time we visited Disneyland was prior to 9 11 so we expected some entrance issues with new security but found that the security lines were extremely long as were the lines to get into the park. And if you wanted to  hop  parks, the lines were long no matter what time we decided to see the other park. What's the point of the hand stamp if there isn't a special entrance to move people through quickly? Aside from Saturday morning from 8:00   10:30 which was lovely because it wasn't crowded, everything had a line. It was clear that Disneyland wasn't prepared for the crowds. At California Adventure it took almost an hour to get lunch at the burger place by Soarin' over California. We also had problems with trying to eat dinner at the River Belle Terrace. After waiting 20 minutes (the line hadn't moved at all), we decided to just grab something at the Bengal Barbeque. Not exactly what we had in mind for dinner, but by then, we were all so tired, hungry and frustrated with the lines that we just wanted something easy. Unfortunately because everything was so crowded it did tend to bring out the worst in people. We found that many were extremely rude and would bump into us (or run us over with a stroller or mechanized wheel chair). FastPass did work most of the time (although we had to do Splash Mountain on a different day because it wasn't running during our FastPass time) but not all rides offer this option. The Monster's Inc. ride at California Adventure had an hour long wait for a less than 4 minute ride. Definitely not worth the wait!! So the worst were the people. The best were still some of the rides like Soarin' Over California, Grizzly River Run (Fast Pass both of these), the new and improved Space Mountain (definitely worth a ride) and the Talk with Crush (California Adventure) was really well done and very cute. All in all, it'll be quite a while before we would even consider returning to Disneyland. Disney has always been a bit money grubbing but it was abundantly clear that once you bought your ticket, they could care less about your experience.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like
1236,4517747,1,missing,United States,"We visited Disneyland during the 50th Anniversary Celebration and for me it was very disappointing. We visited on February 20 22. We purchased the 3 day parker hoppers so we could visit Disneyland and California Adventure. This was the first visit for my girls who at 7 and 4 were very excited about visiting Disney. We took out 7 year old out of school for a few days and thought February would be a good time to visit and we might just avoid the huge crowds that converge on Disney during the summer months. Well, we were wrong. It seems that there isn't a really good time to visit and avoid the huge crowds. Our first day was a Monday and it was a holiday so we expected them to be crowded since school was out. The following Tuesday and Wednesday were not any better. Seems a lot of other people had the same idea. The only times we were able to ride any of the rides were first thing in the morning. By noon it was impossible to get on any ride without having to wait well over 45 minutes to an hour. Certain rides did have the Fast Pass which did work well but that is only used for certain rides and even then is not always used. There is a line for everything at Disneyland and California Adventure. You wait in a line to have your bags checked before you even enter the park. On the third day the line was really long. Once you enter the park you have to wait in a line to show them your ticket. Once inside the park the lines really start. You wait in a large, crowded group line at Main Street for the actual rides to open. Then when they open there is a mad dash my grown ups with small children and strollers to get to the rides. If your not careful you could be run over. On our visit we knew at least 2 rides would be closed. On the first day we got in line for the Matterhorn only for them to close it as we were walking up because of some problem. We finally got to ride it on the 3rd day but heard later that same day that it was closed again. Spash Mountain was not running the first 2 days, finally at the end of our 3rd day we saw it was running. We eventually were able to ride some of the rides that we wanted to ride. It is just very frustrating and almost like work instead of fun to go on the rides. Even trying to ride the kiddy rides was difficult. We waited for at least 30 40 minutes to ride the tea cups, which my little girls enjoyed very much. I just wondered if the 4 grown men in line ahead of us enjoyed it too. Grown ups waiting in lines for rides that are for small children, I just did not understand. The worst part was probably the very rude people. People who would crowd in front of you so they could get a better view of a parade or a character. They would push their kids right in front of other kids who had been standing in a line to see one of the characters. We stood in a line for about 25 30 minutes for my girls to get a picture and autograph from Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. They did get there picture and autograph but I had to point out to this one man where the line started. Had I not done that my girls would have missed out since the princesses had to leave after seeing my girls. People started lining up along the street at 6:00 for the parade that started at 7:15. We sat a table near Main Street about 30 45 mins and started out with a pretty good view of where the parade would pass by. Just as the parade was getting ready to start, people tried to crowd us out of where we had been sitting. Trying to push their children in front of us, pulling the chairs away from where we had been sitting and even standing on the table. And then these same people were overheard complaining because their children could not see the parade. There were way to many people, the food was overpriced, the Cast Members were not very friendly and we hardly ever saw any of them smile. From my memory of visiting when I was a child it sure seemed to be a lot nicer place to visit. For the price that we paid we came away very disappointed it what we got for our money. It seems the only thing that is important at Disneyland is money. It seems that no one cares about it anymore. Trash in the water, bathrooms smelled and paper and trash in the streets. I'm glad that my girls got to visit Disneyland but it will be a long while before we ever return again. It was just not a very good experience for us.

Since the 50th Anniversary began, Disneyland has been anything but the  Happiest Place On Earth . According to my husband, it was the  Most Miserable Place On Earth .On 12 10 05, I called DelivEARS to inquire about a shopping pass for 12 11 05. I was informed that I would be able to get a shopping pass for that day.On 12 11 05, my mom and I left Bakersfield for the 3 hour drive down to Anaheim to shop at Disneyland.After a very long 3 hour drive and $70. in fuel, we were told that due to filming in Disneyland no shopping passes were being issued that day. I made a verbal and written complaint to Disneyland, but Disneyland did not compensate me for the lost time or money.Then when renewing an annual pass on line, the Disneyland web site was experiencing technical difficulties and we did not get our early renewal discount of $20. I wrote an e mail addressing the web site error and asked for my discount but received no reply. I had to write a written letter accusing Disneyland of FALSE ADVERTISEMENT before I was offered my $20. discount   BUT   I had to wait in a line at Guest Services to get my $20. refund, and no other compensation was offered. As annual passholder's, we receive special mailings and offers from Disneyland. My 7 year old daughter was sent an elaborate mailer advertising the opening of the new Monstres' Inc., ride at Disney's California Adventure. The mailer gave instructions to print coloring and activity pages from the computer. Since we all like Monsters' Inc., we planed a trip to Disneyland 1 20 06   1 22 06, so we could experience the new attraction. I always check the Disneyland web site for attraction closurers, weather forecast, etc. According to the web site everything would be open except Goofy's Bounce House, The Haunted Mansion, and the Redwood Creek Challange trail. After a week of my children coloring Monsters' Inc., coloring pages, watching the movie, etc. they were very excited to ride the new ride.As we went to ride the new Monsters' Inc., ride, it was CLOSED due to some celebrity that we had never heard of being there for a media event. Obviously, this was a planned event   WHY THEN DID THE DISNEYLAND WEB SITE NOT LIST THE RIDE IN THE CLOSED ATTRACTION SECTION???Once again I made a verbal complaint, and once again Disneyland did not care. It is my opinion that Disneyland does not care about the customer   just the customer's money. Once Disneyland has your money, Disneyland does not care if you're a satisfied customer   all Disneyland cares about is having your money.Since the 50 th Anniversary, I have notice long lines, over crowding, poor service and rude cast members. Disneyland is so focused on promoting the 50th Anniversary to make as much money as possible that Disneyland does not care about customer satisfaction.

My children wanted to go to Magic Mountain, but I suggested Disneyland. Since I wasn't sure if my grandson could go on most of the rides at the other theme park. And I used to love Disneyland. Big mistake on my part. Let me start with admission prices,  way overpriced  I paid $438.00 for 7 adults and 1 child. My daughters took 2 friends. Over $250.00 on just snacks, bottled waters, and dinner.And that does not include the money that my son and his wife spent. I couln't even afford to get my kids a souvenir this year. But that is not the worst of it. We spent most of our day waiting in line. There should be some kind of limit on how many people are allowed into the park. I know the Disney Corp. really doesn't care. All they are concerned about is raking in the money. They do not care how miserable people are spending most of their day waiting in lines, for snacks attractions, rides, food, and even the restroom. Well I was very disappointed this year.

To be fair, there are a few things the disney management have added. $50 a person per day for less attractions than before. Plenty of cash generating retail and restaurant spaces that use to be attractions. Multiple rides closed for months and sometimes years for refurbishment. Shorter operating hours for people who like seeing less for full price. The only good thing about Disneyland is enjoying the remaining original attractions that Walt built.

1242,2945119,1,missing,United States,"We were visited the Disneyland Resort on Dec 20th to Dec 22th and here are our observation:The park is overcrowded with people and even with the best effort from the staff, is was a dissaster. The average wait for all the rides ranging from 30 min to 2 hours, yes, two hours for a five minutes ride. Somebody will suggest fast pass, but face this, a certain ride can only accomodate a certain amount of park goers per hour, it does not stretching the time or reduce the number of people waiting in turn so it a zero sum game.There is only one bathroom facility per cluster of attraction, says Toon Town, somebody just try to squeeze more rides into same amount of space without giving additional bathrooms or rest areas.The train ride around the park is fine during daylight but at night is totally dark around you with very few lighting, it's very scary for little children to say the least.There is very few signs or kiosk for direction to go from one area of the park to another. The staff at the entrance does not giving out the map or giving instructions to where a particular attraction is.Half way throught the park openning hours, there are trashes everywhere, don't blame the staff for not keeping up, I have seen them tried to sweep the trashes while hordes of people streaming around and kicking the trashes around. The real problem is overcrowded condition. I'm supprised that the fire department is not cited this park for safety condition.The saving grace for the trip is not the park itself but the people of Anaheim (hotel maid, grocery clerk, laudromat owner) who're showing their friendliness and hospitality.

1243,2831747,1,missing,United States,"I will agree that Disneyworld is the happiest place on earth. Disneyland is definately the unhappiest place on earth after fighting crowds for only a few hours. Disneyland is in dire need of customer service and reconstruction to accomodate the crowds. Each theme park in Disneyworld seems to cater to specific age groups. My son being three years old doesn't need rides that rip his teeth out of his mouth. The MGM Theme Park in Disneyworld catered to smaller rides, puppet shows and low key entertainment. The park has much more room to walk around and lots of stands to buy small items like hot dogs, pretzels, popcorn, ect. Disneyland you will find only snacks that do not contain any other item but sugar...candybars, ice cream bars, soda pop, slushes, etc. If you want real food in Disneyland expect to stand in line at the only 1 or 2 walk up grills, and expect it to be spendy for a sandwich and soda. Oh, there are other restaurants that you can sit down and enjoy a lunch, but for a family of four it will really get spendy. The nice people at Disneyworld never hassle you about your backpacks with one or two bottles of water and a few snacks for your toddler. At Disneyland it is worse that going through airport security. They will confiscate anything edible they can dig out of your bags. My advise....save up the money for flight tickets and spend your money at Disneyworld.

1244,1774784,2,missing,United Kingdom,"I just visited Disneyland and was quite disappointed with the number of ride closures! We were aware that Space Mountain was closed for the year, but many other rides attractions were closed frequently for problems. To list a few:  Indiana Jones   we obtained a fastpass and when we returned the ride was closed. The next day, once again the ride was closed and finally on our third try we managed to get on. (It was a good ride, for your information and worth the wait).  Matterhorn   we were told by other people that they spent 75 minutes in the lineup only to be turned away when they got to the entrance as the ride was shutdown for maintenance after problems. People were led off the ride. This occured on at least 2 3 occasions. We gave up and didn't bother going on it. Pirates of the Caribbean   We went on this ride after about a 30 minute wait and got stuck on it at the part where the town is all singing  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!  for at least 30 minutes. This is not a pleasant experience and actually people were getting kind of panicky.  Haunted Mansion   We had a temporary stall when we were on this ride, but only for about 5 minutes. Still, this added to the list of malfunctions in the park.We were not pleased to find we had arrived during the California Spring Easter Break and lineups and crowds were overwhelming.Unlike most reviews, however, we really enjoyed California Adventure. If you are going, check out the restaurant by Soaring over California   the  all dressed fries  (not sure of the name, but they have fries, chili, sour cream, cheese, onions, etc and are fabulous and a good bargain!)
