669660324,2,2018-10,United States,It is no doubt a legendary place but I just dont think it's worth the money and headache of overcrowding and overpriced everything. Disney continues to raise the price of admission and the crowds are ridiculous every single day. There are plenty of things to do in SoCal that are cheap or free. Save your family hundreds of dollars and go somewhere else. ,Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like,Negative
669505006,1,missing,United States,"I   ve been to Disneyland several times in the past 3 decades. This visit, I sensed the employees were disgruntled or unhappy. Very few smiles from the staff. In addition, the staff was prowling for people crossing the ropes while Fantasmic was on. Why do we need a Fastpass to enter to watch the Fan tasmic show when everyone has been situated and there is tons of space for paying customers without a Fastpass? See attached picture. Through the whole show, the entire space was unoccupied while there were 5 8 yr olds next to us straining to catch a glimpse.If you wanna pay $129 to stand in line for hours to ride an average of 9 rides that last 3 to 11 minute, this is the place for you. Disneyland has become so greedy that they overcrowd by double capacity just to make money without a care for their customers. It   s ridiculous to have minimal places to sit and rest with this large of a park. I highly recommend Universal Studios VIP pass over this mess.",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line,Negative
668730191,2,2019-4,United Kingdom,"My partner and I paid $149 each for tickets to this park as my partner wanted to see the original Disney castle.When paying for the tickets nothing was mentioned about a couple of issues we had.Firstly we walked through and tried to take a photo using a selfie stick to be told we either have to throw it away or take it back to the car or hotel as they are banned. So we had to leave and come back again.Then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying, but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn   t even visible as they are working on it or something. It was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us.We should have been told as we   d have left the park for another LA holiday and not wasted $300.Disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment The only good thing was out breakfast in the Carnation Cafe where the staff were superb and the Apple cinnamon pancakes to die for.All in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to Disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like,Negative
667955757,1,2019-1,Australia,"To all who comes to this happy place, welcome. Well Walts vision has been lost along the way over the past few years as this is my third and final trip to Disneyland. I have never experienced so many rude and obnoxious staff throughout the park as we did this time. If the staff are that unhappy with their jobs or pay then step aside and give a job to someone who wants to work. Disney has just turned into a massive cash cow who can't handle the large crowds but keep jamming people into the park until it becomes uncomfortable. We were fully aware of the large crowds of the Christmas period but disneyland promoted activities for you to enjoy and when we arrived at these events people were being moved along by staff, saying that you cannot stand there.Disney have made WiFi available in the park aswell and this just leads to people not watching where they are going because all people are doing is looking at phones instead of watching where they are walking.Do yourself a favor and go to Knotts Berry Farm, its a lot cheaper and not as crowded.",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like,Negative
664615049,1,2019-4,Australia,"I am really disappointed with Disneyland.Old, tired, over crowded and prices are simply a money grab.The fast pass is a rip off and only allows you to reserve a ride every 2 hours.Fast pass again is a money grab that allows people to pay extra money to jump the queue in front of other customers. This is so wrong on many levels. Honest paying customers having to wait in line longer while others jump the queue. I absolutely hate what the fast pass allows. It makes my blood boil as these rich people jump the queue ahead of me. From listening to others in the lines, others agree. Poor form!The characters are hardly seen, forget a photo, there are so many people.Admission price, really.. very over priced. 2 put of 10 stars",Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like,Negative
663791913,1,2019-4,United States,The max pass worked ok for Disneyland but not California Adventure. All the fast passes are gone within a few hours so it is a waste. The new system has doubled the wait times in the stand by lines because as they will tell you  fast pass riders have priority.  Under the old system you pulled a fast pass ticket for free. When you time to use it came you stood in a short line. While you waited for the fast pass time you stood in a line. Now you either stand in a line for fast pass if you can get one or you stand in a line with a few hour wait time. This was all a scheme for Disney to make more money and in the end it made things worse as far as wait times go.,Disneyland_California,9,ride park line wait time disneyland dai disnei peopl hour crowd pass place visit like,Negative

Some people come for the Whole Experience! What a huge Disappointment for the large amount of money you spent! Visited both parks and were extremely overcrowded! I   m so happy to see you are making it NO SMOKING, Maybe you could make it an Adults only Morning Admission sometime?? I have 6 kids and we went for a little getaway and gift to each and it was not even what we thought! My experience at the other park was the worst! I was knocked over by a little boy!

662738160,2,2019-3,Australia,"Dear DisneylandAfter paying $1000USD for tickets for my family. I don   t think I   m being unreasonable to ask for the following. DISNEYLAND CASTLE I couldn   t believe that there wasn   t any notifications to advise you are renovating the castle and it   s currently all covered up. We missed our chance for the iconic photo in front of the castle. WORKING RIDES. we wasted so much time on your broken down rides. We were stuck inside Splash Mountain for 30mins and then escorted out of the canoes, through the attraction and out to the backlot. There was no apology. Indiana Jones broke down 3 times. My husband and daughter were stuck for 45mins and we were turned around twice due to the ride malfunctioning. Haunted Mansion closed as we approached with our fast pass and then we went up to Roger Rabbit in ToonTown only to be told the ride is closed after lining up. Then being part of an angry mob of people who were turned away and having to rejoin the back of the queue when it reopened. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APP TO ADVISE WHEN RIDES ARE CLOSED!FIX YOUR WIFI Your wifi reminds me of Australia   s NBN, never working and only available in a couple of spots around the place. In 2019, it   s a minimum to offer wifi especially with a large percentage of international travellers. CROWD CONTROL last Thursday, I felt like a sardine. There must be a limit to the number of people who can access this place. It was really unpleasant being squashed in a crowd with young children and aggressive pram pushers. THE GOOD? Fast passes and golden hour. I would have left Disney without these options. Also having the option to go to California Adventure Park. It   s a shame that it   s taken me 44 years to get to Disneyland and although I enjoyed my day, it was Ted the magical experience that I hoped for.

Some staff helpful but normally looking like they would rather be somewhere else. Food costs high and again staff    unenthusiastic    at providing assistance. We   ve been to Disney Florida, Universal Florida and California and have never encountered wait times like this. There is no entertainment, no updates on wait times or staff available when waiting in these lines, just the same tracks of music playing over and over.

661874846,1,2019-3,United States,No les recomiendo visitar Disneyland esta bien ocupado y las lineas vien largas mas de dos horas es ridiculo y los tickets bien caros uno trabaja bien dura por su dinero no es justo que cobren tanto. Espere mad de 2 horas para el juego de carros radiators spring para que me dijeran que se desconpuso. No se los recommiendo no es gusto para uno como papa tener que esperar tanto. really busy and long wait for rides. We waited 2 1 2 hours for radiator springs racer just to me told the ride was not working they gave us a fast past but still its ridiculous. We had 3 day park tickets so we went the next day and got a fast past to avoid the issue of waiting when our time came the fast past line was long and the wait was 45 60 min we could not wait as we had to leave.There was a lot of people and tickets are so expensive as an adult I would not want to visit Disney again your better off visiting Six Flags.,Disneyland_California,5,lo que screen cancer ho measur es bien para intens tinkerbel hora uno baton se,Negative

Talked to 3 different service agents at different times. (2 agents were rude, the last nice) All they would say is sorry, last agent said try the credit card company or talked to the front gate customer service.MasterCard said the transaction had already been processed Went to the front gate... More sorry nothing can be done here, go inside and talk to Customer RelationsTalked to Customer Relations, just more sorry we can   t do anything from another 2 agents I have been to Disneyland over 50 times since 1977, I WILL NEVER GO BACKThe whole experience ruined our trip, be Warned: Disney is a corporation and only cares about their bottom line",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line,Negative

659354552,2,2019-3,United States,"I   m sad that Disneyland makes you wait in line for Hours to    plead    your case for why your disabled child should get a disability pass. It   s unfair in a very cruel way. They won   t look at your doctors notes. You have to explain,or beg, why your child, should be allowed a pass, Which I kinda get but at the same time, find it very discriminatory. I don   t think they like they way I looked. He didn   t even listen to me. Said he didn   t understand big words, medical terms mean nothing to him, he is not a doctor. He was beyond rude . He was outright mean. I picked a Disney vacation because they cater to families with disabled children. Or at least I thought they did. We were celebrating my daughters last chemo. Which is great and all, but unfortunately because of 28 MONTHS of intense chemo and the high dose steroids to treat blood cancer she has severe osteonecrosis, which we can   t treat because it requires total joint replacement of her ankles, knees and hips, which is not possible during treatment, so we have to wait until her anc comes back with normal numbers and she is healthy enough to undergo such intense surgery. In about 3 months. Until then she lives in intense pain which is ongoing for over a year.  Osteonecrosis is dead bone. My daughters is extremely severe. It   s an extremely painful condition. But that didn   t qualify her for a pass. But a lady standing next to me, her son didn   t like loud noises, he got a pass. I was mind blown. I didn   t even go seeking this out. A cast member, an employee of Disney told me to go do this. To get a DAS pass after seeing her struggle to stand and wince in pain while meeting tinkerbell . The man assessing whether or not my daughter was disabled enough for a pass looked me dead in the eye and asked me why i brought her to Disneyland if she was sick and in pain. What kind of question in that?? I thought it was Disneyland. The happiest place on earth. She has at least 12 major upcoming surgeries, she has been on treatment for cancer for over two years. Why wouldn   t I bring her to Disneyland? We could have went there for a make a wish trip, but she wished something else. She later expressed her desire to have went to Disney and I took her on my own make a wish, and even though Disneyland is actually quite crappy to disabled people. I still got to see her smile and light up at seeing the parade. The joy on her face was contagious at meeting tinkerbell. All in, I   m glad she got to complete her dream of going to Disneyland. She could only do about 3 hours a day, on a 3 day pass. But it   s whatever. We came and saw. We rode 1 ride a day. We wouldn   t dream of ever going back and for that, I   m thankful.",Disneyland_California,7,told disneyland cast ask disnei said member dai park employe ticket peopl ride time line,Negative
659054990,1,2019-3,United States,Cindy is by far the worst employee i have come across in the 26 yrs I have been going to disneyland. She was working at the red cart which sells corn dogs. She lied to us and was super rude when we found out other people had ordered the exact thing we were trying to (which she claimed was not possible). Seriously disneyland needs to hire nicer people if they are going to advertise disneyland as the happiest place on earth.

656088536,2,2019-2,United States,Many rides were closed for maintenance. Then other rides shut down while waiting in line. Couldn't even use the FastPass for one of them (Indiana Jones) because it never re opened. Had to return to Thunder Mountain after already waiting an hour before it broke down the first time. Was able to use the Fastpass from Indy to shorten the wait when we returned.

We also have never been to California but figured since we were so close that visiting Disneyland was a MUST!. We went in February which was off season and everything was just okay. It was so overcrowded. Even being offseason, i can't imagine what the busy season looks like or how you could even function.Everyone is packed together and the park is pretty outdated and it shows. For the amount of money Disney brings in and charges they should be ashamed of the condition of the park. Just slapping new paint on old rides and giving it a new name. I know its a type of marketing and branding but the park size is just way to small for the amount of people to go in there.People are rude, My daughter and wife got puked on by some guy getting off a ride at the park. Ive also been to Disney world as we are from the east coast. If you are reading this based on choosing... Go there. its the same cooperate structure but it is far larger and superior as parks go.

Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover.
